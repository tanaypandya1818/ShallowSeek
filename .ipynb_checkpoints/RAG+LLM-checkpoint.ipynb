Cockroaches, like many insects, are indeed equipped with wings, and some are capable of flight. However, their preferred mode of locomotion is often scurrying or running, much like a soldier in full armor avoiding the heat of battle. As for jumping, it is not their forte, unlike the locust, which is known for its remarkable leaping abilities. Thus, one could say that cockroaches are more akin to infantrymen, marching across the terrain, than to the cavalry, soaring through the air or leaping over obstacles.\n"
