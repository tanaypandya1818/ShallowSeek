    "chapter": "CHAP. 56.—THE PROPER TIMES FOR SOWING.",
    "answer": "The optimal sowing time is a matter of much debate. Some hold that sowing should be avoided near the winter solstice, as seeds sown just before may take up to forty days to sprout, while those sown earlier emerge within a week.\n\nSome believe early sowing risks disappointment, while late sowing guarantees it. Others prefer spring sowing to a poor autumn, targeting the period between the west winds and the vernal equinox.\n\nThe celestial phenomena also play a role. Virgil advises sowing wheat and spelt at the setting of the Vergiliæ, barley between the autumnal equinox and winter solstice, and vetches, kidney-beans, and lentils at the setting of Boötes. Some advocate sowing before the setting of the Vergiliæ in dry, hot regions, while others suggest waiting about seven days after, anticipating rain.\n\nSoil type also influences the decision. Cold soils should be sown soon after the autumnal equinox, while warmer soils should be sown later to prevent premature growth before winter.\n"
