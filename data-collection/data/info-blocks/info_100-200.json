    "paragraphs": [
      "There are, however, some tides which are of a peculiar nature, as in the Tauromenian Euripus<@1>, where the ebb and flow is more frequent than in other places, and in Eubœa, where it takes place seven times during the day and the night. The tides intermit three times during each month, being the 7th, 8th and 9th day of the moon<@2>. At Gades, which is very near the temple of Hercules, there is a spring enclosed like a well, which sometimes rises and falls with the ocean, and, at other times, in both respects contrary to it. In the same place there is another well, which always agrees with the ocean. On the shores of the Bætis<@3>, there is a town where the wells become lower when the tide rises, and fill again when it ebbs; while at other times they remain stationary. The same thing occurs in one well in the town of Hispalis<@4>, while there is nothing peculiar in the other wells. The Euxine always flows into the Propontis, the water never flowing back into the Euxine<@5>."

    "paragraphs": [
      "Hence it is that the widely-diffused sea is impregnated with the flavour of salt, in consequence of what is sweet and mild being evaporated from it, which the force of fire easily accomplishes; while all the more acrid and thick matter is left behind; on which account the water of the sea is less salt at some depth than at the surface. And this is a more true cause of the acrid flavour, than that the sea is the continued perspiration of the land<@1>, or that the greater part of the dry vapour is mixed with it, or that the nature of the earth is such that it impregnates the waters, and, as it were, medicates them<@2>. Among the prodigies which have occurred, there is one which happened when Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, was expelled from his kingdom; that, for the space of one day, the water in the harbour became sweet.",
      "(101.) The moon, on the contrary, is said to be a feminine and delicate planet, and also nocturnal; also that it resolves humours and draws them out, but does not carry them off. It is manifest that the carcases of wild beasts are rendered putrid by its beams, that, during sleep, it draws up the accumulated torpor into the head, that it melts ice, and relaxes all things by its moistening spirit<@3>. Thus the changes of nature compensate each other, and are always adequate to their destined purpose; some of them congealing the elements of the stars and others dissolving them. The moon is said to be fed by fresh, and the sun by salt water."

The alleged facts are, for the most part, without foundation, and I am not aware of any circumstance which could, originally, have made them a part of the popular creed of so many nations, ancient as well as modern. Perhaps some of the effects which have been ascribed to the specific action of the moon, may be explained by the lower temperature and greater dampness of the air, during the absence of the sun."

    "paragraphs": [
      "It is very remarkable that fresh water should burst out close to the sea, as from pipes. But there is no end to the wonders that are connected with the nature of waters. Fresh water floats on sea water, no doubt from its being lighter; and therefore sea water, which is of a heavier nature<@1>, supports better what floats upon it. And, in some places, different kinds of fresh water float upon each other; as that of the river which falls into the Fucinus; that of the Addua into the Larius; of the Ticinus into the Verbanus; of the Mincius into the Benacus; of the Ollius into the Sevinus; and of the Rhone into the Leman lake<@2> (this last being beyond the Alps, the others in Italy): all which rivers passing through the lakes for many miles, generally carry off no more water than they bring with them. The same thing is said to occur in the Orontes, a river of Syria, and in many others",
      "Some rivers, from a real hatred of the sea, pass under it, as does Arethusa, a fountain of Syracuse, in which the substances are found that are thrown into the Alpheus; which, after flowing by Olympia, is discharged into the sea, on the shore of the Peloponnesus<@3>. The Lycus in Asia<@4>, the Era- sinus in Argolis, and the Tigris<@5> in Mesopotamia, sink into the earth and burst out again. Substances which are thrown into the fountain of Æsculapius at Athens<@6> are cast up at the fountain of Phalerum. The river which sinks into the ground in the plain of Atinum<@7> comes up again at the distance of twenty miles, and the Timavus does the same in Aquileia<@8>.",
      "In the lake Asphaltites, in Judæa, which produces bitumen, no substance will sink, nor in the lake Arethusa<@9>, in the Greater Armenia: in this lake, although it contains nitre, fish are found. In the country of the Salentini, near the town of Manduria, there is a lake<@10> full to the brim, the waters of which are never diminished by what is taken out of it, nor increased by what is added. Wood, which is thrown into the river of the Cicones<@11>, or into the lake Velinus in Picenum, becomes coated with a stony crust, while in the Surius, a river of Colchis, the whole substance becomes as hard as stone. In the same manner, in the Silarus<@12>, beyond Surrentum, not only twigs which are immersed in it, but likewise leaves are petrified; the water at the same time being proper for drinking. In the stream which runs from the marsh of Reate<@13> there is a rock, which continues to increase in size, and in the Red Sea olive-trees and green shrubs are produced<@14>.",
      "There are many springs which are remarkable for their warmth. This is the case even among the ridges of the Alps<@15>, and in the sea itself, between Italy and Ænaria, as in the bay of Baiæ, and in the Liris and many other rivers<@16>. There are many places in which fresh water may be procured from the sea, as at the Chelidonian Isles, and at Arados, and in the ocean at Gades. Green plants are produced in the warm springs of Padua, frogs in those of Pisa, and fish in those of Vetulonia in Etruria, which is not far from the sea. In Casinas there is a cold river called Scatebra, which in summer is more full of water<@17>. In this, as in the river Stymphalis, in Arcadia, small water-mice are produced. The fountain of Jupiter in Dodona, although it is as cold as ice, and extinguishes torches that are plunged into it, yet, if they be brought near it, it kindles them again<@18>. This spring always becomes dry at noon, from which circumstance it is called αναπαυόμενον<@19> it then increases and becomes full at midnight, after which it again visibly decreases. In Illyricum there is a cold spring, over which if garments are spread they take fire. The pool of Jupiter Ammon, which is cold during the day, is warm during the night<@20>. In the country of the Troglodytæ<@21>, what they call the Fountain of the Sun, about noon is fresh and very cold; it then gradually grows warm, and, at midnight, becomes hot and saline<@22>.",
      "In the middle of the day, during summer, the source of the Po, as if reposing itself, is always dry<@23>. In the island of Tenedos there is a spring, which, after the summer solstice, is full of water, from the third hour of the night to the sixth<@24>. The fountain Inopus, in the island of Delos, decreases and increases in the same manner as the Nile, and also at the same periods<@25>. There is a small island in the sea, opposite to the river Timavus, containing warm springs, which increase and decrease at the same time with the tides of the sea<@26>. In the territory of Pitinum, on the other side of the Apennines, the river Novanus, which during the solstice is quite a torrent, is dry in the winter<@27>.",
      "In Faliscum, all the water which the oxen drink turns them white; in Bœotia, the river Melas turns the sheep black; the Cephissus, which flows out of a lake of the same name, turns them white<@28>; again, the Peneus turns them black, and the Xanthus, near Ilium, makes them red, whence the river derives its name<@29>. In Pontus, the river Astaces waters certain plains, where the mares give black milk, which the people use in diet. In Reate there is a spring called Neminia, which rises up sometimes in one place and sometimes in another, and in this way indicates a change in the produce of the earth<@30>. There is a spring in the harbour of Brundisium that yields water which never becomes putrid at sea. The water of the Lyncestis, which is said to be acidulous, intoxicates like wine<@31>; this is the case also in Paphlagonia<@32> and in the territory of Calenum<@33>. In the island of Andros, at the temple of Father Bacchus, we are assured by Mucianus, who was thrice consul, that there is a spring, which, on the nones of January, always has the flavour of wine; it is called διὸς θεοδοσία<@34>. Near Nonacris, in Arcadia, the Styx<@35>, which is not unlike it either in odour or in colour, instantly destroys those who drink it. Also in Librosus, a hill in the country of the Tauri, there are three springs which inevitably produce death, but without pain. In the territory of the Carrinenses in Spain<@36>, two springs burst out close together, the one of which absorbs everything, the other throws them out. In the same country there is another spring, which gives to all the fish the appearance of gold, although, when out of the water, they do not differ in any respect from other fish. In the territory of Como, near the Larian lake, there is a copious spring, which always swells up and subsides again every hour<@37>. In the island of Cydonea<@38>, before Lesbos, there is a warm fountain, which flows only during the spring season. The lake Sinnaus<@39>, in Asia, is impregnated with wormwood, which grows about it. At Colophon, in the cave of the Clarian Apollo, there is a pool, by the drinking of which a power is acquired of uttering wonderful oracles; but the lives of those who drink of it are shortened<@40>. In our own times, during the last years of Nero's life, we have seen rivers flowing backwards, as I have stated in my history of his times<@41>.",
      "And indeed who can be mistaken as to the fact, that all springs are colder in summer than in winter<@42>, as well as these other wonderful operations of nature; that copper and lead sink when in a mass, but float when spread out<@43>; and of things that are equally heavy, some will sink to the bottom, while others will remain on the surface<@44>; that heavy bodies are more easily moved in water<@45>; that a stone from Scyros, although very large, will float, while the same, when broken into small pieces, sinks<@46>; that the body of an animal, newly deprived of life, sinks, but that, when it is swelled out, it floats<@47>; that empty vessels are drawn out of the water with no more ease than those that are full<@48>; that rain-water is more useful for salt-pits than other kinds of water<@49>; that salt cannot be made, unless it is mixed with fresh water<@50>; that salt water freezes with more difficulty<@51>, and is more readily heated<@52>; that the sea is warmer in winter<@53> and more salt in the autumn<@54>; that everything is soothed by oil, and that this is the reason why divers send out small quantities of it from their mouths, because it smoothes any part which is rough<@55> and transmits the light to them; that snow never falls in the deep part of the sea<@56>; that although water generally has a tendency downwards, fountains rise up<@57>, and that this is the case even at the foot of Ætna<@58>, burning as it does, so as to force out the sand like a ball of flame to the distance of 150 miles?"

      "Among the wonders of mountains there is Ætna, which always burns in the night<@1>, and for so long a period has always had materials for combustion, being in the winter buried in snow, and having the ashes which it has ejected covered with frost. Nor is it in this mountain alone that nature rages, threatening to consume the earth<@2>; in Pha- selis, the mountain Chimæra burns, and indeed with a continual flame, day and night<@3>. Ctesias of Cnidos informs us, that this fire is kindled by water, while it is extinguished by earth and by hay<@4>. In the same country of Lycia, the mountains of Hephæstius, when touched with a flaming torch<@5>, burn so violently, that even the stones in the river and the sand burn, while actually in the water: this fire is also increased by rain. If a person makes furrows in the ground with a stick which has been kindled at this fire, it is said that a stream of flame will follow it. The summit of Cophantus, in Bactria<@6>, burns during the night; and this is the case in Media and at Sittacene<@7>, on the borders of Persia; likewise in Susa, at the White Tower, from fifteen apertures<@8>, the greatest of which also burns in the daytime. The plain of Babylon throws up flame from a place like a fishpond<@9>, an acre in extent. Near Hesperium, a mountain of the Æthiopians<@10>, the fields shine in the night-time like stars; the same thing takes place in the territory of the Megalopo- litani. This fire, however, is internal<@11>, mild, and not burning the foliage of a dense wood which is over it<@12>. There is also the crater of Nymphæum<@13>, which is always burning, in the neighbourhood of a cold fountain, and which, according to Theopompus, presages direful calamities to the inhabitants of Apollonia<@14>. It is increased by rain<@15>, and it throws out bitumen, which, becoming mixed with the fountain, renders it unfit to be tasted; it is, at other times, the weakest of all the bitumens. But what are these compared to other wonders? Hiera, one of the Æolian isles, in the middle of the sea, near Italy, together with the sea itself, during the Social war, burned for several days<@16>, until expiation was made, by a deputation from the senate. There is a hill in Æthiopia called θεῶνὄχημα<@17>, which burns with the greatest violence, throwing out flame that consumes everything, like the sun<@18>. In so many places, and with so many fires, does nature burn the earth!"

      "But since this one element is of so prolific a nature as to produce itself, and to increase from the smallest spark, what must we suppose will be the effect of all those funeral piles of the earth<@1> ? What must be the nature of that thing, which, in all parts of the world, supplies this most greedy voracity without destroying itself? To these fires must be added those innumerable stars and the great sun itself. There are also the fires made by men<@2>, those which are innate in certain kinds of stones, those produced by the friction of wood<@3>, and those in the clouds, which give rise to lightning. It really exceeds all other wonders, that one single day should pass in which everything is not consumed, especially when we reflect, that concave mirrors placed opposite to the sun's rays produce flame more readily than any other kind of fire; and that numerous small but natural fires abound everywhere. In Nymphæum there issues from a rock a fire which is kindled by rain; it also issues from the waters of the Scantia<@4>. This indeed is a feeble flame, since it passes off, remaining only a short time on any body to which it is applied: an ash tree, which overshadows this fiery spring, remains always green<@5>. In the territory of Mutina fire issues from the ground on the days that are consecrated to Vulcan<@6>. It is stated by some authors, that if a burning body falls on the fields below Aricia<@7>, the ground is set on fire; and that the stones in the territory of the Sabines and of the Sidicini<@8>, if they be oiled, burn with flame. In Egnatia<@9>, a town of Salentinum, there is a sacred stone, upon which, when wood is placed, flame immediately bursts forth. In the altar of Juno Lacinia<@10>, which is in the open air, the ashes remain unmoved, although the winds may be blowing from all quarters.",
      "It appears also that there are sudden fires both in waters and even in the human body; that the whole of Lake Thrasymenus was on fire<@11>; that when Servius Tullius, while a child, was sleeping, flame darted out from his head<@12>; and Valerius Antias informs us, that the same flame appeared about L. Marcius, when he was pronouncing the funeral oration over the Scipios, who were killed in Spain; and exhorting the soldiers to avenge their death. I shall presently mention more facts of this nature, and in a more distinct manner; in this place these wonders are mixed up with other subjects. But my mind, having carried me beyond the mere interpretation of nature, is anxious to lead, as it were by the hand, the thoughts of my readers over the whole globe."

    "paragraphs": [
      "Our part of the earth, of which I propose to give an account, floating as it were in the ocean which surrounds it (as I have mentioned above<@1>), stretches out to the greatest extent from east to west, viz. from India to the Pillars consecrated to Hercules at Gades, being a distance of 8568 miles<@2>, according to the statement of Artemidorus<@3>, or ac- cording to that of Isidorus<@4>, 9818 miles. Artemidorus adds to this 491 miles, from Gades, going round by the Sacred Promontory, to the promontory of Artabrum<@5>, which is the most projecting part of Spain.",
      "This measurement may be taken in two directions. From the Ganges, at its mouth, where it discharges itself into the Eastern ocean, passing through India and Parthyene, to Myriandrus<@6>, a city of Syria, in the bay of Issus, is a distance of 5215 miles<@7>. Thence, going directly by sea, by the island of Cyprus, Patara in Lycia, Rhodes, and Astypalæa, islands in the Carpathian sea, by Tænarum in Laconia, Lilybæum in Sicily and Calaris in Sardinia, is 2103 miles. Thence to Gades is 1250 miles, making the whole distance from the Eastern ocean 8568 miles<@8>.",
      "The other way, which is more certain, is chiefly by land. From the Ganges to the Euphrates is 5169 miles; thence to Mazaca, a town in Cappadocia, is 319 miles; thence, through Phrygia and Caria, to Ephesus is 415 miles; from Ephesus, across the Ægean sea to Delos, is 200 miles; to the Isthmus is 212 1/2 miles; thence, first by land and afterwards by the sea of Lechæum and the gulf of Corinth, to Patræ in Peloponnesus, 90 miles; to the promontory of Leucate 87 1/2 miles; as much more to Corcyra; to the Acroceraunian mountains 132 1/2, to Brundisium 87 1/2, and to Rome 360 miles. To the Alps, at the village of Scingomagum<@9>, is 519 miles; through Gaul to Illiberis at the Pyrenees, 927; to the ocean and the coast of Spain, 331 miles; across the passage of Gades 7 1/2 miles; which distances, according to the estimate of Artemidorus, make altogether 8945 miles.",
      "The breadth of the earth, from south to north, is commonly supposed to be about one-half only of its length, viz. 4490 miles; hence it is evident how much the heat has stolen from it on one side and the cold on the other: for I do not suppose that the land is actually wanting, or that the earth has not the form of a globe; but that, on each side, the uninhabitable parts have not been discovered. This measure then extends from the coast of the Æthiopian ocean, the most distant part which is habitable, to Meroë, 1000 miles<@10>; thence to Alexandria 1250; to Rhodes 562; to Cnidos 87 1/2; to Cos 25; to Samos 100; to Chios 94; to Mitylene 65; to Tenedos 44; to the promontory of Sigæum 12 1/2; to the entrance of the Euxine 312 1/2; to the promontory of Carambis 350; to the entrance of the Palus Mæotis 312 1/2; and to the mouth of the Tanais 275 miles, which distance, if we went by sea, might be shortened 89 miles. Beyond the Tanais the most diligent authors have not been able to obtain any accurate measurement. Artemidorus supposes that everything beyond is undiscovered, since he confesses that, about the Tanais, the tribes of the Sarmatæ dwell, who extend towards the north pole. Isidorus adds 1250 miles, as the distance to Thule<@11>; but this is mere conjecture. For my part, I believe that the boundaries of Sarmatia really extend to as great a distance as that mentioned above: for if it were not very extensive, how could it contain the innumerable tribes that are always changing their residence ? And indeed I consider the uninhabitable portion of the world to be still greater; for it is well known that there are innu- merable islands lying off the coast of Germany<@12>, which have been only lately discovered.",
      "The above is all that I consider worth relating about the length and the breadth of the earth<@13>. But Eratosthenes<@14>, a man who was peculiarly well skilled in all the more subtle parts of learning, and in this above everything else, and a person whom I perceive to be approved by every one, has stated the whole of this circuit to be 252,000 stadia, which, according to the Roman estimate, makes 31,500 miles. The attempt is presumptuous, but it is supported by such subtle arguments that we cannot refuse our assent. Hipparchus<@15>, whom we must admire, both for the ability with which he controverts Eratosthenes, as well as for his diligence in everything else, has added to the above number not much less than 25,000 stadia.",
      "(109.) Dionysodorus is certainly less worthy of confidence<@16>; but I cannot omit this most remarkable instance of Grecian vanity. He was a native of Melos, and was celebrated for his knowledge of geometry; he died of old age in his native country. His female relations, who inherited his property, attended his funeral, and when they had for several successive days performed the usual rites, they are said to have found in his tomb an epistle written in his own name to those left above; it stated that he had descended from his tomb to the lowest part of the earth, and that it was a distance of 42,000 stadia. There were not wanting certain geometricians, who interpreted this epistle as if it had been sent from the middle of the globe, the point which is at the greatest distance from the surface, and which must necessarily be the centre of the sphere. Hence the estimate has been made that it is 252,000 stadia in circumference."

      "Thus far have I treated of the position and the wonders of the earth, of the waters, the stars, and the proportion of the universe and its dimensions. I shall now proceed to describe its individual parts; although indeed we may with reason look upon the task as of an infinite nature, and one not to be rashly commenced upon without incurring censure. And yet, on the other hand, there is nothing which ought less to require an apology, if it is only considered how far from surprising it is that a mere mortal cannot be acquainted with everything. I shall therefore not follow any single author, but shall employ, in relation to each subject, such writers as I shall look upon as most worthy of credit. For, indeed, it is the characteristic of nearly all of them, that they display the greatest care and accuracy in the description of the countries in which they respectively flourished; so that by doing this, I shall neither have to blame nor contradict any one.",
      "The names of the different places will here be simply given, and as briefly as possible; the account of their celebrity, and the events which have given rise thereto, being deferred to a more appropriate occasion; for it must be remembered that I am here speaking of the earth as a whole, and I wish to be understood as using the names without any reference whatever to their celebrity, and as though the places themselves were in their infancy, and had not as yet acquired any fame through great events. The name is men- tioned, it is true, but only as forming a part of the world and the system of the universe.",
      "The whole globe is divided into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Our description commences where the sun sets and at the Straits of Gades<@1>, where the Atlantic ocean, bursting in, is poured forth into the inland seas. As it makes its entrance from that side, Africa is on the right hand and Europe on the left; Asia lies between them<@2>; the boundaries being the rivers Tanais<@3> and Nile. The Straits of the ocean, of which I have just spoken, extend fifteen miles in length and five<@4> in breadth, measured from the village of Mellaria<@5> in Spain to the Album Promontorium<@6> or White Promontory in Africa, as we learn from Turranius Gracilis, who was born in that vicinity. Titus Livius and Cornelius Nepos however have stated the breadth, where it is least, to be seven miles, and where greatest, ten; from so small a mouth as this does so immense an expanse of water open upon us! Nor is our astonishment diminished by the fact of its being of great depth; for, instead of that, there are numerous breakers and shoals, white with foam, to strike the mariner with alarm. From this circumstance it is, that many have called this spot the threshold of The Inland Sea.",
      "At the narrowest part of the Straits, there are mountains placed to form barriers to the entrance on either side, Abyla<@7> in Africa, and Calpe<@8> in Europe, the boundaries formerly of the labours of Hercules<@9>. Hence it is that the inhabitants have called them the Columns of that god; they also believe that they were dug through by him; upon which the sea, which was before excluded, gained admission, and so changed the face of nature."

      "3": "Now the Don. It was usually looked upon as the boundary between Europe and Asia. Pliny's meaning seems to be, that the Tanais divides Asia from Europe, and the Nile, Asia from Africa, the more especially as the part to the west of the Nile was sometimes considered as belonging to Asia. It has been however suggested that he intends to assign these rivers as the extreme eastern boundaries of the internal or Mediterranean sea.",

      "I shall first then speak of Europe, the foster-mother of that people which has conquered all other nations, and itself by far the most beauteous portion of the earth. Indeed, many persons have, not without reason<@1>, considered it, not as a third part only of the earth, but as equal to all the rest, looking upon the whole of our globe as divided into two parts only, by a line drawn from the river Tanais to the Straits of Gades. The ocean, after pouring the waters of the Atlantic through the inlet which I have here described, and, in its eager progress, overwhelming all the lands which have had to dread its approach, skirts with its winding course the shores of those parts which offer a more effectual resistance, hollowing out the coast of Europe especially into numerous bays, among which there are four Gulfs that are more particularly remarkable. The first of these begins at Calpe, which I have previously mentioned, the most distant mountain of Spain; and bends, describing an immense curve, as far as Locri and the Promontory of Bruttium<@2>."

The Farther Spain is divided lengthwise into two provinces, Lusitania<@4> and Bætica, the former stretching along the northern side of the latter, and being divided from it by the river Ana<@5>. The source of this river is in the district of Laminium<@6>, in the Nearer Spain. It first spreads out into a number of small lakes, and then again contracts itself into a narrow channel, or entirely disappears under ground<@7>, and after frequently disappearing and again coming to light, finally dis- charges itself into the Atlantic Ocean. Tarraconensian Spain lies on one side, contiguous to the Pyrenees, running down- wards along the sides of that chain, and, stretching across from the Iberian Sea to the Gallic ocean<@8>, is separated from Bætica and Lusitania by Mount Solorius<@9>, the chains of the Oretani<@10> and the Carpetani<@11>, and that of the Astures<@12>."

      "Bætica, so called from the river which divides it in the middle, excels all the other provinces in the richness of its cultivation and the peculiar fertility and beauty of its vegetation.",
      "It consists of four jurisdictions, those of Gades<@1>, of Corduba<@2>, of Astigi<@3>, and of Hispali<@4>. The total number of its towns is 175; of these nine are colonies<@5>, and eight muni- cipal towns<@6>; twenty-nine have been long since presented with the old Latin rights<@7>; six are free towns<@8>, three federate<@9>, and 120 tributary.",
      "In this district, the things that more especially deserve notice, or are more easily explained in the Latin tongue, are the following, beginning at the river Ana, along the line of the seashore; the town of Onoba, surnamed Æstuaria<@10>; the rivers Luxia and Urium<@11>, flowing through this territory between the Ana and the Bætis; the Marian<@12> Mountains; the river Bætis; the coast of Corum<@13>, with its winding bay; opposite to which is Gades, of which we shall have occasion to speak among the islands<@14>. Next comes the Promontory of Juno<@15>, and the port of Bæsippo<@16>; the towns of Bœlo<@17> and Mellaria<@18>, at which latter begin the Straits of the Atlantic; Carteia<@19>, called by the Greeks Tartessos<@20>; and the mountain of Calpe.",
      "Along the coast of the inland sea<@21> is the town of Barbesula<@22> with its river; also Salduba<@23>; the town of Suel<@24>; and then Malaca<@25>, with its river, one of the federate towns. Next to this comes Mænoba<@26>, with its river; then Sexifirmum<@27>, surnamed Julium; Selambina<@28>; Abdera<@29>; and Murci<@30>, which is at the boundary of Bætica. M. Agrippa supposed that all this coast was peopled by colonists of Punic origin. Beyond the Anas, and facing the Atlantic, is the country of the Bastuli<@31> and the Turditani. M. Varro informs us, that the Iberians, the Persians, the Phœnicians, the Celts, and the Carthaginians spread themselves over the whole of Spain; that the name \"Lusitania\" is derived from the games (lusus) of Father Bacchus, or the fury (lyssa<@32>) of his frantic attendants, and that Pan<@33> was the governor of the whole of it. But the traditions respecting Hercules<@34> and Pyrene, as well as Saturn, I conceive to be fabulous in the highest degree.",
      "The Bætis does not rise, as some writers have asserted, near the town of Mentisa<@35>, in the province of Tarraco, but in the Tugiensian Forest<@36>; and near it rises the river Tader<@37>, which waters the territory of Carthage<@38>. At Ilorcum<@39> it turns away from the Funeral Pile<@40> of Scipio; then taking a sweep to the left, it falls into the Atlantic Ocean, giving its name to this province: at its source it is but small, though during its course it receives many other streams, which it deprives as well of their waters as their renown. It first enters Bætica in Ossigita-nia<@41>, and glides gently, with a smooth current, past many towns situate on either side of its banks.",
      "Between this river and the sea-shore the most celebrated places inland are Segida<@42>, also surnamed Augurina; Julia<@43>, called Fidentia; Urgao<@44> or Alba, Ebora<@45> or Cerealis, Iliberri<@46> or Liberini, Ilipula<@47> or Laus, Artigi<@48> or Julienses, Vesci<@49> or Faventia, Singili<@50>, Attegua<@51>, Arialdunum, Agla Minor<@52>, Bæbro<@53>, Castra Vinaria<@54>, Cisimbrium<@55>, Hippo Nova or New Hippo<@56>, Ilurco<@57>, Osca<@58>, Escua<@59>, Sucubo<@60>, Nuditanum, Old Tuati<@61>; all which towns are in that part of Bastitania which extends towards the sea, but in the jurisdiction<@62> of Corduba. In the neighbourhood of the river itself is Ossigi<@63>, also surnamed Laconicum, Iliturgi<@64> or Forum Julium, Ipasturgi<@65> or Triumphale, Setia, and, fourteen miles inland, Obulco<@66>, which is also called Pontificense.",
      "Next to these comes Epora<@67>, a federate town, Sacili<@68> Martialium, and Onoba<@69>. On the right bank is Corduba, a Roman colony, surnamed Patricia<@70>; here the Bætis first becomes navigable. There are also the towns of Carbula and Detunda<@71>, and the river Singulis<@72>, which falls into the Bætis on the same side.",
      "The towns in the jurisdiction of Hispalis are the following: Celti, Arua<@73>, Canama<@74>, Evia, Ilipa<@75>, surnamed Illa, and Italica<@76>. On the left of the river is the colony of Hispalis<@77> named Romuliensis, and, on the opposite side<@78>, the town of Osset<@79>, surnamed Julia Constantia, Vergentum, or Juli Genius<@80>, Orippo, Caura<@81>, Siarum, and the river Menoba<@82>, which enters the Bætis on its right bank. Between the æstuaries of the Bætis lie the towns of Nebrissa<@83>, surnamed Veneria, and of Colobona<@84>. The colonies are, Asta<@85>, which is also called Regia, and, more inland, that of Asido<@86>, surnamed Cæsariana.",
      "The river Singulis, discharging itself into the Bætis at the place already mentioned, washes the colony of Astigi<@87>, sur- named Augusta Firma, at which place it becomes navigable. The other colonies in this jurisdiction which are exempt from tribute are Tucci, surnamed Augusta Gemella<@88>, Itucci called Virtus Julia<@89>, Attubi or Claritas Julia<@90>, Urso<@91> or Genua Urbanorum; and among them in former times Munda<@92>, which was taken with the son of Pompey. The free towns are Old Astigi<@93> and Ostippo<@94>; the tributary towns are Callet, Callecula, Castra Gemina, the Lesser Ilipula, Merucra, Sacrana, Obulcula<@95>, and Oningis. As you move away from the sea-coast, near where the river Menoba is navigable, you find, at no great distance, the Alontigiceli and the Alostigi<@96>.",
      "The country which extends from the Bætis to the river Anas, beyond the districts already described, is called Bæturia, and is divided into two parts and the same number of nations; the Celtici<@97>, who border upon Lusitania, in the ju- risdiction of Hispalis, and the Turduli, who dwell on the verge<@98> of Lusitania and Tarraconensis, and are under the protection of the laws of Corduba. It is evident that the Celtici have sprung from the Celtiberi, and have come from Lusitania, from their religious rites, their language, and the names of their towns, which in Bætica are distinguished by the following epithets<@99>, which have been given to them. Seria has received the surname of Fama Julia<@100>, Nertobriga that of Concordia Julia<@101>, Segida that of Restituta Julia<@102>, and Contributa<@103> that of Julia. What is now Curiga was formerly Ucultuniacum, Constantia Julia<@104> was Laconimurgis, the present Fortunales were the Tereses<@105>, and the Emanici were the Callenses<@106>. Besides these, there are in Celtica the towns of Acinippo<@107>, Arunda<@108>, Aruci<@109>, Turobriga, Lastigi, Salpesa, Sæpone, and Serippo.",
      "The other Bæturia, which we have mentioned, is inhabited by the Turduli, and, in the jurisdiction of Corduba, has some towns which are by no means inconsiderable; Arsa<@110>, Mellaria<@111>, Mirobriga<@112>, and Sisapo<@113>, in the district of Osintias.",
      "To the jurisdiction of Gades belongs Regina, with Roman citizens; and Læpia, Ulia<@114>, Carisa<@115> surnamed Aurelia, Urgia<@116> or Castrum Julium, likewise called Cæsaris Salutariensis, all of which enjoy the Latian rights. The tributary towns are Besaro, Belippo<@117>, Barbesula, Lacippo, Bæsippo, Callet, Cappacum, Oleastro, Ituci, Brana, Lacibi, Saguntia<@118>, and Audorisæ.",
      "M. Agrippa has also stated the whole length of this province to be 475 miles<@119>, and its breadth 257; but this was at a time when its boundaries extended to Carthage<@120>, a circumstance which has often caused great errors in calculations; which are generally the result either of changes effected in the limits of provinces, or of the fact that in the reckoning of distances the length of the miles has been arbitrarily increased or diminished. In some parts too the sea has been long making encroachments upon the land, and in others again the shores have advanced; while the course of rivers in this place has become more serpentine, in that more direct. And then, besides, some writers begin their measurements at one place, and some at another, and so proceed in different directions; and hence the result is, that no two accounts agree.",
      "(2.) At the present day the length of Bætica, from the town of Castulo<@121>, on its frontier, to Gades is 250 miles, and from Murci, which lies on the sea-coast, twenty-five miles more. The breadth, measured from the coast of Carteia, is 234 miles. Who is there that can entertain the belief that Agrippa, a man of such extraordinary diligence, and one who bestowed so much care on his subject, when he proposed to place before the eyes of the world a survey of that world, could be guilty of such a mistake as this, and that too when seconded by the late emperor the divine Augustus ? For it was that emperor who completed the Portico<@122> which had been begun by his sister, and in which the survey was to be kept, in conformity with the plan and descriptions of M. Agrippa."

At certain times of the year fixed by the proconsul or chief magistrate, the people assembled in the chief town of the district (whence the name 'conventus'), upon which judges were selected to try the causes of litigant parties.",

      "86": "It is not improbable that this was the present city of Xeres. Some geographers however take it to be that of Medina Sidonia, and look upon Xeres as the site of the ancient Asta.",
      "87": "Now Ecija. It stood on the plain of the Bætis, some distance south of the river, on its tributary the Singulis or Xenil.",
      "88": "The site of this place is unknown. It probably obtained its name from being a colony of one of the legions, the 7th, 10th, 13th or 14th; which were called 'geminæ' or 'gemellæ,' from being composed of the men of two legions originally.",
      "89": "\"The Valour of Julius.\" Sanson places it not far from Miragenil.",
      "90": "\"The Fame of Julius.\" Perhaps the present Olivera, or else Teba, six leagues to the south of Estepa.",
      "91": "The present city of Ossuna. \"Genua Urbanorum\" would seem to mean \"the knees of the citizens.\" Though all the MSS. agree in this reading, it probably is an error for \"gemina Urbanorum,\" and it may have been a colony of one of the legions called 'geminæ' or 'gemellæ,' as previously mentioned. The other part of its appellation may possibly have originated in the fact of its first inhabitants being all natives of the city of Rome.",
      "92": "The use of the word fuit, 'was,' implies that the place had been destroyed. Cneius Pompeius, the eldest son of Pompey the Great, was defeated at Munda, in the year B.C. 45, and the town destroyed. Pompey escaped from the battle, but was taken a short time after and put to death. The site of the ancient town is very generally supposed to be the modern village of Monda, S.W. of Malaga, and about three leagues from the sea. It is more probable however that it was in the vicinity of Cordova, and there are ruins of ancient walls and towers between Martos, Alcandete, Espejo and Baena, which are supposed to denote its site.",
      "93": "Now Alameda; eight leagues from the other Astiji or Ecija.",
      "94": "Now Estepa, six leagues from Ecija.",

      "97": "The Celtici are supposed to have inhabited the country between the Guadiana and Guadalquivir, the eastern parts of Alentejo and the west of Estremadura, as far as the city of Badajoz.",
      "98": "Probably part of Estremadura, and the vicinity of Badajoz in an easterly direction.",
      "99": "The exact meaning of this passage is somewhat obscure, but he probably means to say that the Celtici have an identity of sacred rites, language, and names of towns with the Celtiberians; though it had become the usage in Bætica more generally to distinguish the towns by their Roman names.",
      "100": "\"The Fame of Julius.\" Its site is not known.",
      "101": "\"The Concord of Julius.\" Probably the same as the modern Valera la Vega, near Frejenal.",
      "102": "Probably meaning \"Restored by Julius.\" Nothing is known of its site.",
      "103": "According to an authority quoted by Hardouin, this may possibly be Medina de las Torres.",
      "104": "Probably Constantina in Andalusia, to the north of Penaflor.",
      "105": "The tribe or nation of the Tereses are supposed to have dwelt in the vicinity of the modern San Nicolo del Puerto.",
      "106": "Calentum was their town; probably the present Cazalla near Alaniz. This place will be found mentioned by Pliny in B. xxxv. c. 14.",
      "107": "The ruins two leagues north of Ronda la Vieja are supposed to be those of this place. There are the remains of an aqueduct and theatre, and numerous coins are found here.",
      "108": "Probably the present Ronda la Vieja.",
      "109": "Identified by inscriptions with the present Aroche. The sites of several of the following places are unknown.",

      "113": "According to Hardouin, the modern Almaden de la Plata.",
      "114": "Probably the same as the modern Monte Major.",
      "115": "The ruins of this place are probably those seen at Carixa, near Bornos, in the vicinity of Seville.",
      "116": "According to Hardouin, the same as the modern Las Cabezas, not far from Lebrija.",
      "117": "The sites of these two towns are unknown. Bæsippo, Barbesula and Callet have been already mentioned.",
      "118": "The ruins of Saguntia are to be seen between Arcos and Xeres della Frontera, on the river Guadalete; they bear their ancient name under the form of Cigonza. Mela, B. iii. c. 1, says that Oleastro was a grove near the Bay of Cadiz. Brana was probably the same place that is mentioned by Ptolemy under the name of Urbona.",
      "119": "We may here mention for the more correct information of the reader that the Roman mile consisted of 1000 paces, each pace being five English feet.

      "120": "Nova Carthago, or New Carthage.",
      "121": "Now Cazlona, on the confines of New Castile and the kingdom of Granada. It was a place of great importance, and the chief town of the Oretani. Himilce, the rich wife of Hannibal, was a native of this place.",
      "122": "This was the 'porticus Octaviæ,' which, having been commenced by his sister Octavia, the wife of Marcellus and Antony, was completed by Augustus. It lay between the Circus Flaminius and the Theatre of Marcellus, occupying the site of the former portico, which had been built by Q. Cæcilius Metellus, and enclosing the two temples of Juno and of Jupiter Stator. It contained a public library, in which the Senate often met, and it was in this probably that the map or plan, mentioned by Pliny, was deposited. It also contained a great number of statues, paintings, and other works of art, which, with the library, were destroyed by fire in the reign of Titus."

    "paragraphs": [
      "The ancient form of the Nearer Spain, like that of many other provinces, is somewhat changed, since the time when Pompey the Great, upon the trophies which he erected in the Pyrenees, testified that 877 towns, from the Alps to the borders of the Farther Spain, had been reduced to subjection by him. The whole province is now divided into seven jurisdictions, those of Carthage<@1>, of Tarraco, of Cæsar Augusta<@2>, of Clunia<@3>, of Asturica<@4>, of Lucus<@5>, and of the Bracari<@6>. To these are to be added the islands, which will be described on another occasion, as also 293 states which are dependent on others; besides which the province contains 179 towns. Of these, twelve are colonies, thirteen, towns with the rights of Roman citizens, eighteen with the old Latian rights, one confederate, and 135 tributary.",
      "The first people that we come to on the coast are the Bastuli; after whom, proceeding according to the order which I shall follow, as we go inland, there are the Mentesani, the Oretani, and the Carpetani on the Tagus, and next to them the Vaccæi, the Vectones, and the Celtiberian Arevaci. The towns nearest to the coast are Urci, and Barea<@7> included in Bætica, the district of Mavitania, next to it Deitania, and then Contestania, and the colony of Carthago Nova; from the Promontory of which, known as the Promontorium Saturni<@8>, to the city of Cæsarea<@9> in Mauritania, the passage is a distance of 187 miles. The remaining objects worthy of mention on the coast are the river Tader<@10>, and the free colony of Ilici<@11>, whence the Ilicitanian Gulf<@12> derives its name; to this colony the Icositani are subordinate.",
      "We next have Lucentum<@13>, holding Latian rights; Dianium<@14>, a tributary town; the river Sucro<@15>, and in former times a town of the same name, forming the frontier of Contestania. Next is the district of Edetania, with the delightful expanse of a lake<@16> before it, and extending backward to Celtiberia. Valentia<@17>, a colony, is situate three miles from the sea, after which comes the river Turium<@18>, and Saguntum<@19> at the same distance, a town of Roman citizens famous for its fidelity, the river Uduba<@20>, and the district of the Ilergaones<@21>. The Iberus<@22>, a river enriched by its commerce, takes its rise in the country of the Cantabri, not far from the town of Juliobriga<@23>, and flows a distance of 450 miles; 260 of which, from the town of Varia<@24> namely, it is available for the purposes of navigation. From this river the name of Iberia has been given by the Greeks to the whole of Spain.",
      "Next comes the district of Cossetania, the river Subi<@25>, and the colony of Tarraco, which was built by the Scipios as Carthage<@26> was by the Carthaginians. Then the district of the Ilergetes, the town of Subur<@27>, and the river Rubricatum<@28>, beyond which begin the Laletani and the Indigetes<@29>. Behind these, in the order in which they will be mentioned, going back from the foot of the Pyrenees, are the Ausetani<@30>, the Lacetani<@31>, and along the Pyrenees, the Cerretani<@32>, next to whom are the Vascones<@33>. On the coast is the colony of Barcino<@34>, surnamed Faventia; Bætulo<@35> and Iluro<@36>, towns with Roman citizens; the river Larnum<@37>, Blandæ<@38>, the river Alba<@39>; Emporiæ<@40>, a city consisting of two parts, one peopled by the original inhabitants, the other by the Greek descendants of the Phocæans; and the river Ticher<@41>. From this to the Venus Pyrenæa<@42>, on the other side of the Promontory, is a distance of forty miles.",
      "I shall now proceed to give an account of the more remarkable things in these several jurisdictions, in addition to those which have been already mentioned. Forty-three different peoples are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of Tarraco: of these the most famous are—holding the rights of Roman citizens, the Dertusani<@43> and the Bisgargitani; enjoying Latian rights, the Ausetani, and the Cerretani, both Julian and Augustan, the Edetani<@44>, the Gerundenses<@45>, the Gessorienses<@46>, and the Teari<@47>, also called Julienses. Among the tributaries are the Aquicaldenses<@48>, the Onenses, and the Bæculonenses<@49>.",
      "Cæsar Augusta, a free colony, watered by the river Iberus, on the site of the town formerly called Salduba, is situate in the district of Edetania, and is the resort of fifty-five nations. Of these there are, with the rights of Roman citizens, the Bellitani<@50>, the Celsenses<@51>, a former colony, the Calagurritani<@52>, surnamed the Nassici, the Ilerdenses<@53>, of the nation of the Surdaones, near whom is the river Sicoris, the Oscenses<@54> in the district of Vescitania, and the Turiasonenses<@55>. Of those enjoying the rights of the ancient Latins, there are the Cascantenses<@56> the Ergavicenses<@57>, the Graccuritani<@58>, the Leo- nicenses<@59>, and the Osicerdenses; of federate states, there are the Tarragenses<@60>; and of tributaries, the Arcobrigenses<@61>, the Andologenses<@62>, the Aracelitani<@63>, the Bursaonenses<@64>, the Calagurritani<@65>, who are also surnamed the Fibularenses, the Complutenses<@66>, the Carenses<@67>, the Cincenses<@68>, the Cortonenses, the Damanitani<@69>, the Larnenses<@70>, the Lursenses<@71>, the Lumberitani<@72>, the Lacetani, the Lubienses, the Pompelonenses<@73>, and the Segienses.",
      "Sixty-five different nations resort to Carthage<@74>, besides the inhabitants of the islands. Of the Accitanian<@75> colony, there are the Gemellenses, and the town of Libisosona<@76>, surnamed Foroaugustana, to both of which have been granted Italian<@77> rights. Of the colony of Salaria<@78>, there are the people of the following towns, enjoying the rights of ancient Latium: the Castulonenses, also called the Cæsari Venales, the Sætabitani<@79> or Augustani, and the Valerienses<@80>. The best known among the tributaries are the Alabanenses<@81>, the Bastitani<@82>, the Consaburrenses<@83>, the Dianenses<@84>, the Egelestani<@85>, the Ilorcitani<@86>, the Laminitani, the Mentesani<@87>, both those called Oritani and those called Bastuli, and the Oretani who are surnamed Germani<@88>, the people of Segobriga<@89> the capital of Celtiberia, those of Toletum<@90> the capital of Carpetania, situate on the river Tagus, and after them the Viatienses and the Virgilienses<@91>.",
      "To the jurisdiction of Clunia<@92> the Varduli contribute fourteen nations, of whom we need only particularize the Albanenses<@93>, the Turmodigi<@94>, consisting of four tribes, among which are the Segisamonenses<@95> and the Segisamaiulienses. To the same jurisdiction belong the Carietes<@96> and the Vennenses with five states, among which are the Velienses. Thither too resort the Pelendones of the Celtiberians, in four different nations, among whom the Numantini<@97> were especially famous. Also, among the eighteen states of the Vaccæi, there are the Intercatienses<@98>, the Pallantini<@99>, the Lacobrigenses, and the Caucenses<@100>. But among the seven peoples belonging to the Cantabri, Juliobriga<@101> is the only place worthy of mention; and of the ten states of the Autrigones, Tritium and Virovesca<@102>. The river Areva<@103> gives its name to the Arevaci; of whom there are six towns, Segontia<@104> and Uxama<@105>, names which are frequently given to other places, as also Segovia<@106> and Nova Augusta, Termes<@107>, and Clunia itself, the frontier of Celtiberia. The remaining portion turns off towards the ocean, being occupied by the Varduli, already mentioned, and the Cantabri.",
      "Next upon these touch the twenty-two nations of the Astures, who are divided into the Augustani<@108> and the Transmontani, with the magnificent city of Asturica. Among these we have the Cigurri<@109>, the Pæsici, the Lancienses<@110>, and the Zoëlæ<@111>. The total number of the free population amounts to 240,000 persons.",
      "The jurisdiction of Lucus<@112> embraces, besides the Celtici and the Lebuni, sixteen different nations, but little known and with barbarous names. The number however of the free population amounts to nearly 166,000.",
      "In a similar manner the twenty-four states of the jurisdiction of the Bracari contain a population of 175,000, among whom, besides the Bracari<@113> themselves, we may mention, without wearying the reader, the Bibali, the Cœlerni, the Gallæci, the Hequæsi, the Limici, and the Querquerni.",
      "The length of the Nearer Spain, from the Pyrenees to the frontier of Castulo, is 607<@114> miles, and a little more if we follow the line of the coast; while its breadth, from Tarraco to the shore of Olarson<@115>, is 307<@116> miles. From the foot of the Pyrenees, where it is wedged in by the near approach of the two seas, it gradually expands until it touches the Farther Spain, and thereby acquires a width more than double<@117>.",
      "Nearly the whole of Spain abounds in mines<@118> of lead, iron, copper, silver, and gold; in the Nearer Spain there is also found lapis specularis<@119>; in Bætica there is cinnabar. There are also quarries of marble. The Emperor Vespasianus Augustus, while still harassed by the storms that agitated the Roman state, conferred the Latian rights on the whole of Spain. The Pyrenean mountains divide Spain from Gaul, their extremities projecting into the two seas on either side."

      "101": "This was the chief city of the Cantabri. It has been already mentioned, but we may add that it stood near the sources of the Ebro, on the eminence of Retortillo, south of Reynosa. Five stones still mark the boundaries which divided the territory from that of the Fourth Legio.",

This people probably derived their name from their fashion of wearing braccæ, \"breeches\" or \"trowsers,\" like their neighbours of Gallia Braccata. The exact localities of the various other tribes here mentioned do not appear to be exactly known.",
      "114": "Our author is mistaken here, even making allowance for the shortness of the Roman mile (1618 yards), as the length is only 470 miles. Coastwise it is 620.",

      "118": "It may be worth while here to take some notice of the mineral productions of Spain in modern times, from which we shall be able to form a more accurate judgement as to the correctness of the statement here made by Pliny. Grains of gold are still to be found in the rivers Tagus and Douro; but there is not found sufficient of the precious metal to pay for the search. Silver is found in the mines of the Guadal canal. Copper and lead are to be found in abundance. There is a mine of plumbago four leagues from Ronda; and tin is found in Gallicia. In every province there are iron mines, those in Biscay being the most remarkable. Lodestone is found in Seville, cobalt on the Pyrenees, quicksilver and cinnabar at Almaden, arsenic in Asturias, and coal in Asturias and Arragon. There are salt-mines at Mingrilla and Cardona; alum is found in Arragon, antimony at Alcaraz. On the Sierra Morena, and in Gallicia, there is saltpetre in numerous localities; amber in Asturias and Valencia, and sulphur in Murcia, Arragon, and Seville. Pipe-clay of a peculiar quality is found in the vicinity of Andujar. Gypsum and marble are found in great abundance, and stone for building purposes, of the best quality. Amethysts, white cornelians, rubies, agates, garnets, and rock crystals, with other precious stones, are also found in abundance and of the finest quality.",
      "119": "Transparent stone. Further mention is made of it by Pliny in B. xxxv. c. 45."

    "paragraphs": [
      "That part of the Gallias which is washed by the inland sea<@1> is called the province of [Gallia] Narbonensis<@2>, having formerly borne the name of Braccata<@3>. It is divided from Italy by the river Varus<@4>, and by the range of the Alps, the great safeguards of the Roman Empire. From the remainder of Gaul, on the north, it is separated by the mountains Cebenna<@5> and Jura<@6>. In the cultivation of the soil, the manners and civilization of the inhabitants, and the extent of its wealth, it is surpassed by none of the provinces, and, in short, might be more truthfully described as a part of Italy than as a province. On the coast we have the district of the Sordones<@7>, and more inland that of the Consuarani<@8>. The rivers are the Tecum and the Vernodubrum<@9>. The towns are Illiberis<@10>, the scanty remains of what was formerly a great city, and Ruscino<@11>, a town with Latian rights. We then come to the river Atax<@12>, which flows from the Pyrenees, and passes through the Rubrensian Lake<@13>, the town of Narbo Martius, a colony of the tenth legion, twelve miles distant from the sea, and the rivers Arauris<@14> and Liria<@15>. The towns are otherwise but few in number, in consequence of the numerous lakes<@16> which skirt the sea-shore. We have Agatha<@17>, formerly belonging to the Massilians, and the district of the Volcæ Tectosages<@18>; and there is the spot where Rhoda<@19>, a Rhodian colony, formerly stood, from which the river takes its name of Rhodanus<@20>; a stream by far the most fertilizing of any in either of the Gallias. Descending from the Alps and rushing through lake Lemanus<@21>, it carries along with it the sluggish Arar<@22>, as well as the torrents of the Isara and the Druentia<@23>, no less rapid than itself. Its two smaller mouths are called Libica<@24>, one being the Spanish, and the other the Metapinian mouth; the third and largest is called the Massiliotic<@25>. There are some authors who state that there was formerly a town called Heraclea<@26> at the mouth of the Rhodanus or Rhone.",
      "Beyond this are the Canals<@27> leading out of the Rhone, a famous work of Caius Marius, and still distinguished by his name; the Lake of Mastramela<@28>, the town of Maritima<@29> of the Avatici, and, above this, the Stony Plains<@30>, memorable for the battles of Hercules; the district of the Anatilii<@31>, and more inland, that of the Desuviates<@32> and the Cavari. Again, close upon the sea, there is that of the Tricorii<@33>, and inland, there are the Tricolli<@34>, the Vocontii<@35>, and the Segovellauni, and, after them, the Allobroges<@36>.",
      "On the coast is Massilia, a colony of Phocæan<@37> Greeks, and a federate<@38> city; we then have the Promontory of Zao<@39>, the port of Citharista<@40>, and the district of the Camatullici<@41>; then the Suelteri<@42>, and above them the Verrucini<@43>.

On the faith of this inscription, Spon and Ducange have placed Heraclea at the modern Saint-Gilles, and other writers at Saint-Remy, where the inscription was found. Unfortunately, however, Messrs.

      "Next comes Italy, and we begin with the Ligures<@1>, after whom we have Etruria, Umbria, Latium, where the mouths of the Tiber are situate, and Rome, the Capital of the world, sixteen miles distant from the sea. We then come to the coasts of the Volsci and of Campania, and the districts of Picenum, of Lucania, and of Bruttium, where Italy extends the farthest in a southerly direction, and projects into the [two] seas with the chain of the Alps<@2>, which there forms pretty nearly the shape of a crescent. Leaving Bruttium we come to the coast of [Magna] Græcia, then the Salentini, the Pediculi, the Apuli, the Peligni, the Frentani, the Marrucini, the Vestini, the Sabini, the Picentes, the Galli, the Umbri, the Tusci, the Veneti, the Carni, the Iapydes, the Histri, and the Liburni.",
      "I am by no means unaware that I might be justly accused of ingratitude and indolence, were I to describe thus briefly and in so cursory a manner the land which is at once the foster-child<@3> and the parent of all lands; chosen by the providence of the Gods to render even heaven itself more glorious<@4>, to unite the scattered empires of the earth, to bestow a polish upon men's manners, to unite the discordant and uncouth dialects of so many different nations by the powerful ties of one common language, to confer the enjoyments of discourse and of civilization upon mankind, to become, in short, the mother-country of all nations of the Earth.",
      "But how shall I commence this undertaking? So vast is the number of celebrated places (what man living could enumerate them all?), and so great the renown attached to each individual nation and subject, that I feel myself quite at a loss. The city of Rome alone, which forms a portion of it, a face well worthy of shoulders so beauteous, how large a work would it require for an appropriate description! And then too the coast of Campania, taken singly by itself! so blest with natural beauties and opulence, that it is evident that when nature formed it she took a delight in accumulating all her blessings in a single spot—how am I to do justice to it? And then the climate, with its eternal freshness and so replete with health and vitality, the sereneness of the weather so enchanting, the fields so fertile, the hill sides so sunny, the thickets so free from every danger, the groves so cool and shady, the forests with a vegetation so varying and so luxuriant, the breezes descending from so many a mountain, the fruitfulness of its grain, its vines, and its olives so transcendent; its flocks with fleeces so noble, its bulls with necks so sinewy, its lakes recurring in never-ending succession, its numerous rivers and springs which refresh it with their waters on every side, its seas so many in number, its havens and the bosom of its lands opening everywhere to the commerce of all the world, and as it were eagerly stretching forth into the very midst of the waves, for the purpose of aiding as it were the endeavours of mortals!",
      "For the present I forbear to speak of its genius, its manners, its men, and the nations whom it has conquered by eloquence and force of arms. The very Greeks themselves, a race fond in the extreme of expatiating on their own praises, have amply given judgment in its favour, when they named but a small part of it 'Magna Græcia<@5>.' But we must be content to do on this occasion as we have done in our description of the heavens; we must only touch upon some of these points, and take notice of but a few of its stars. I only beg my readers to bear in mind that I am thus hasten- ing on for the purpose of giving a general description of everything that is known to exist throughout the whole earth.",
      "I may premise by observing that this land very much resembles in shape an oak leaf, being much longer than it is broad; towards the top it inclines to the left<@6>, while it terminates in the form of an Amazonian buckler<@7>, in which the spot at the central projection is the place called Cocinthos, while it sends forth two horns at the end of its crescent-shaped bays, Leucopetra on the right and Lacinium on the left. It extends in length 1020 miles, if we measure from the foot of the Alps at Prætoria Augusta, through the city of Rome and Capua to the town of Rhegium, which is situate on the shoulder of the Peninsula, just at the bend of the neck as it were. The distance would be much greater if measured to Lacinium, but in that case the line, being drawn obliquely, would incline too much to one side. Its breadth is variable; being 410 miles between the two seas, the Lower and the Upper<@8>, and the rivers Varus and Arsia<@9>: at about the middle, and in the vicinity of the city of Rome, from the spot where the river Aternus<@10> flows into the Adriatic sea, to the mouth of the Tiber, the distance is 136 miles, and a little less from Castrum-novum on the Adriatic sea to Alsium<@11> on the Tuscan; but in no place does it exceed 200 miles in breadth. The circuit of the whole, from the Varus to the Arsia, is 3059 miles<@12>.",
      "As to its distance from the countries that surround it- Istria and Liburnia are, in some places<@13>, 100 miles from it, and Epirus and Illyricum 50; Africa is less than 200, as we are informed by M. Varro; Sardinia<@14> is 120, Sicily 1 1/2, Corsica less than 80, and Issa<@15> 50. It extends into the two seas towards the southern parts of the heavens, or, to speak with more minute exactness, between the sixth<@16> hour and the first hour of the winter solstice.",
      "We will now describe its extent and its different cities; in doing which, it is necessary to premise, that we shall follow the arrangement of the late Emperor Augustus, and adopt the division which he made of the whole of Italy into eleven districts; taking them, however, according to their order on the sea-line, as in so hurried a detail it would not be possible otherwise to describe each city in juxtaposition with the others in its vicinity. And for the same reason, in describing the interior, I shall follow the alphabetical order which has been adopted by that Emperor, pointing out the colonies of which he has made mention in his enumeration. Nor is it a very easy task to trace their situation and origin; for, not to speak of others, the Ingaunian Ligurians have had lands granted to them as many as thirty different times."

      "Next to this comes the seventh region, in which is Etruria, a district which begins at the river Macra, and has often changed its name. At an early period the Umbri were expelled from it by the Pelasgi; and these again by the Lydians, who from a king of theirs<@1> were named Tyrrheni, but afterwards, from the rites observed in their sacrifices, were called, in the Greek language<@2>, Tusci. The first town in Etruria is Luna<@3>, with a noble harbour, then the colony of Luca<@4>, at some distance from the sea, and nearer to it again the colony of Pisæ<@5>, between the rivers Auser<@6> and Arnus<@7>, which owes its origin to Pelops and the Pisans<@8>, or else to the Teutani, a people of Greece. Next is Vada<@9> Volaterrana, then the river Cecinna<@10>, and Populonium<@11> formerly belonging to the Etrurians, the only town they had on this coast. Next to these is the river Prile<@12>, then the Umbro<@13>, which is navigable, and where the district of Umbria begins, the port of Telamon<@14>, Cosa<@15> of the Volcientes, founded by the Roman people, Graviscæ<@16>, Castrum novum<@17>, Pyrgi<@18>, the river Cæretanus<@19>, and Cære<@20> itself, four miles inland, called Agylla by the Pelasgi who founded it, Alsium<@21>, Fregenæ<@22>, and the river Tiber, 284<@23> miles from the Macra.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "The Tiber or Tiberis, formerly called Thybris, and previously Albula<@2>, flows down from nearly the central part of the chain of the Apennines, in the territory of the Arretini. It is at first small, and only navigable by means of sluices, in which the water is dammed up and then discharged, in the same manner as the Timia<@3> and the Glanis, which flow into it; for which purpose it is found necessary to collect the water for nine days, unless there should happen to be a fall of rain. And even then, the Tiber, by reason of its rugged and uneven channel, is really more suitable for navigation by rafts than by vessels, for any great distance. It winds along for a course of 150 miles, passing not far from Tifernum<@4>, Perusia, and Ocriculum<@5>, and dividing Etruria from the Umbri<@6> and the Sabini<@7>, and then, at a distance of less than sixteen miles from the city, separating the territory of Veii from that of Crustuminum, and afterwards that of the Fidenates and of Latium from Vaticanum.",
      "Below its union with the Glanis from Arretinum the Tiber is swollen by two and forty streams, particularly the Nar<@8> and the Anio, which last is also navigable and shuts in Latium at the back; it is also increased by the numerous aqueducts and springs which are conveyed to the City. Here it becomes navigable by vessels of any burden which may come up from the Italian sea; a most tranquil dispenser of the produce of all parts of the earth, and peopled and embellished along its banks with more villas than nearly all the other rivers of the world taken together. And yet there is no river more circumscribed than it, so close are its banks shut in on either side; but still, no resistance does it offer, although its waters frequently rise with great suddenness, and no part is more liable to be swollen than that which runs through the City itself. In such case, however, the Tiber is rather to be looked upon<@9> as pregnant with prophetic warnings to us, and in its increase to be considered more as a promoter of religion than a source of devastation.",
      "Latium<@10> has preserved its original limits, from the Tiber to Circeii<@11>, a distance of fifty miles: so slender at the beginning were the roots from which this our Empire sprang. Its inhabitants have been often changed, and different nations have peopled it at different times, the Aborigines, the Pelasgi, the Arcades, the Seculi, the Aurunci, the Rutuli, and, beyond Circeii, the Volsci, the Osci, and the Ausones whence the name of Latium came to be extended as far as the river Liris<@12>.",
      "We will begin with Ostia<@13>, a colony founded by a king of Rome, the town of Laurentum<@14>, the grove of Jupiter Indiges<@15>, the river Numicius<@16>, and Ardea<@17>, founded by Danaë, the mother of Perseus. Next come the former site of Aphrodisium<@18>, the colony of Antium<@19>, the river and island called Astura<@20>, the river Nymphæus<@21>, the Clostra Romana<@22>, and Circeii<@23>, formerly an island, and, if we are to believe Homer, surrounded by the open sea, though now by an extensive plain. The circumstances which we are enabled to publish on this subject for the information of the world are very remarkable. Theophrastus, the first foreigner who treated of the affairs of Rome with any degree of accuracy (for Theopompus, before whose time no Greek writer had made mention of us, only stated the fact that the city had been taken by the Gauls, and Clitarchus, the next after him, only spoke of the embassy that was sent by the Romans to Alexander)—Theophrastus, I say, following something more than mere rumour, has given the circuit of the island of Circeii as being eighty stadia, in the volume which he wrote during the archonship of Nicodorus at Athens<@24>, being the 440th year of our city. Whatever land therefore has been annexed to that island beyond the circumference of about ten miles, has been added to Italy since the year previously mentioned.",
      "Another wonderful circumstance too.—Near Circeii are the Pomptine Marshes<@25>, formerly the site, according to Mucianus, who was thrice consul, of four-and-twenty cities. Next to this comes the river Ufens<@26>, upon which is the town of Terracina<@27>, called, in the language of the Volsci, Anxur; the spot too where Amyclæ<@28> stood, a town destroyed by serpents. Next is the site of the Grotto<@29>, Lake Fundanus<@30>, the port of Caieta<@31>, and then the town of Formiæ<@32>, formerly called Hormiæ, the ancient seat of the Læstrygones<@33>, it is supposed. Beyond this, formerly stood the town of Pyræ; and we then come to the colony of Minturnæ<@34>, which still exists, and is divided<@35> by the river Liris, also called the Glanis. The town of Sinuessa<@36> is the last in the portion which has been added to Latium; it is said by some that it used to be called Sinope.",
      "At this spot begins that blessed country Campania<@37>, and in this vale first take their rise those hills clad with vines, the juice of whose grape is extolled by Fame all over the world; the happy spot where, as the ancients used to say, father Liber and Ceres are ever striving for the mastery. Hence the fields of Setia<@38> and of Cæcubum<@39> extend afar. and, next to them those of Falernum<@40> and of Calinum<@41>. As soon as we have passed these, the hills of Massica<@42>, of Gaurus<@43>, and of Surrentum rise to our view. Next, the level plains of Laborium<@44> are spread out far and wide, where every care is bestowed on cultivating crops of spelt, from which the most delicate fermenty is made. These shores are watered by warm springs<@45>, while the seas are distinguished beyond all others for the superlative excellence of their shell and other fish. In no country too has the oil of the olive a more exquisite flavour. This territory, a battle-ground as it were for the gratification of every luxurious pleasure of man, has been held successively by the Osci, the Greeks, the Umbri, the Tusci, and the Campani.",
      "On the coast we first meet with the river Savo<@46>, the town of Volturnum with a river<@47> of the same name, the town of Liternum<@48>, Cumæ<@49>, a Chalcidian colony, Misenum<@50>, the port of Baiæ<@51>, Bauli<@52>, the Lucrine Lake<@53>, and Lake Avernus, near which there stood formerly a town<@54> of the Cimmerians. We then come to Puteoli<@55>, formerly called the colony of Dicæ- archia, then the Phlegræn<@56> Plains, and the Marsh of Acherusia<@57> in the vicinity of Cumæ.",
      "Again, on the coast we have Neapolis<@58>, also a colony of the Chalcidians, and called Parthenope from the tomb there of one of the Sirens, Herculaneum<@59>, Pompeii<@60>, from which Mount Vesuvius may be seen at no great distance, and which is watered by the river Sarnus<@61>; the territory of Nuceria, and, at the distance of nine miles from the sea, the town of that name<@62>, and then Surrentum<@63>, with the Promontory of Minerva<@64>, formerly the abode of the Sirens. The distance thence by sea to Circeii is seventy-eight miles This region, beginning at the Tiber, is looked upon as the first of Italy according to the division of Augustus.",
      "Inland there are the following colonies:—Capua<@65>, so called from its champaign country, Aquinum<@66>, Suessa<@67>, Venafrum<@68>, Sora<@69>, Teanum surnamed Sidicinum<@70>, Nola<@71>; and the towns of Abella<@72>, Aricia<@73>, Alba Longa<@74>, the Acer- rani<@75>, the Allifani<@76>, the Atinates<@77>, the Aletrinates<@78>, the Anagnini<@79>, the Atellani<@80>, the Affilani<@81>, the Arpinates<@82>, the Auximates<@83>, the Abellani<@84>, the Alfaterni (both those who take their names from the Latin, the Hernican and the Labicanian territory), Bovillæ<@85>, Calatia<@86>, Casi- num<@87>, Calenum<@88>, Capitulum<@89> of the Hernici, the Cereatini<@90>, surnamed Mariani, the Corani<@91>, descended from the Trojan Dardanus, the Cubulterini, the Castrimœnienses<@92>, the Cingulani<@93>, the Fabienses<@94> on the Alban Mount, the Foropopulienses<@95> of the Falernian district, the Frusinates<@96>, the Ferentinates<@97>, the Freginates<@98>, the old Frabaterni<@99>, the new Frabaterni, the Ficolenses<@100>, the Fre- gellani<@101>, Forum Appî<@102>, the Forentani<@103>, the Gabini<@104>, the Interamnates Succasini<@105>, also surnamed Lirinates, the Ilionenses Lavinii<@106>, the Norbani<@107>, the Nomentani<@108>, the Prænestini<@109> (whose city was formerly called Stephané), the Privernates<@110>, the Setini<@111>, the Signini<@112>, the Suessulani<@113>, the Telesini<@114>, the Trebulani, surnamed Balinienses<@115>, the Trebani<@116>, the Tusculani<@117>, the Verulani<@118>, the Veliterni<@119>, the Ulubrenses<@120>, the Urbinates<@121>, and, last and greater than all, Rome herself, whose other name<@122> the hallowed mysteries of the sacred rites forbid us to mention without being guilty of the greatest impiety. After it had been long kept buried in secresy with the strictest fidelity and in respectful and salutary silence, Valerius Soranus dared to divulge it, but soon did he pay the penalty<@123> of his rashness.",
      "It will not perhaps be altogether foreign to the purpose, if I here make mention of one peculiar institution of our forefathers which bears especial reference to the inculcation of silence on religious matters. The goddess Angerona<@124>, to whom sacrifice is offered on the twelfth day before the calends of January [21st December], is represented in her statue as having her mouth bound with a sealed fillet.",
      "Romulus left the city of Rome, if we are to believe those who state the very greatest number, having three<@125> gates and no more. When the Vespasians were emperors<@126> and censors, in the year from its building 826, the circumference of the walls which surrounded it was thirteen miles and two-fifths. Surrounding as it does the Seven Hills, the city is divided into fourteen districts, with 265 cross-roads<@127> under the guardianship of the Lares. If a straight line is drawn from the mile-column<@128> placed at the entrance of the Forum, to each of the gates, which are at present thirty-seven in number (taking care to count only once the twelve double gates, and to omit the seven old ones, which no longer exist), the result will be [taking them altogether], a straight line of twenty miles and 765 paces<@129>. But if we draw a straight line from the same mile-column to the very last of the houses, including therein the Prætorian encampment, and follow throughout the line of all the streets, the result will then be something more than seventy miles. Add to these calculations the height of the houses, and then a person may form a fair idea of this city, and will certainly be obliged to admit that there is not a place throughout the whole world that for size can be compared to it. On the eastern side it is bounded by the agger of Tarquinius Superbus, a work of surpassing grandeur; for he raised it so high as to be on a level with the walls on the side on which the city lay most exposed to attack from the neighbouring plains. On all the other sides it has been fortified either with lofty walls or steep and precipitous hills<@130>, but so it is, that its buildings, increasing and extending beyond all bounds, have now united many other cities to it<@131>.",
      "Besides those previously mentioned, there were formerly in the first region the following famous towns of Latium: Satricum<@132>, Pometia<@133>, Scaptia, Politorium<@134>, Tellene, Tifata, Cænina<@135>, Ficana<@136>, Crustumerium, Ameriola<@137>, Medullum<@138>, Corniculum<@139>, Saturnia<@140>, on the site of the present city of Rome, Antipolis<@141>, now Janiculum, forming part of Rome, Antemnæ<@142>, Carnerium<@143>, Collatia<@144>, Amitinum<@145>, Norbe, Sulmo<@146>, and, with these, those Alban nations<@147> who used to take part in the sacrifices<@148> upon the Alban Mount, the Albani, the Æsulani<@149>, the Accienses, the Abolani, the Bube- tani<@150>, the Bolani<@151>, the Cusuetani, the Coriolani<@152>, the Fidenates<@153>, the Foretii, the Hortenses<@154>, the Latinienses, the Longulani<@155>, the Manates, the Macrales, the Mutucumenses, the Munienses, the Numinienses, the Olliculani, the Octulani, the Pedani<@156>, the Polluscini, the Querquetulani, the Sicani, the Sisolenses, the Tolerienses, the Tutienses, the Vimitellarii, the Velienses, the Venetulani, and the Vitellenses. Thus we see, fifty-three peoples of ancient Latium have passed away without leaving any traces of their existence.",
      "In the Campanian territory there was also the town of Stabiæ<@157>, until the consulship of Cneius Pompeius and L. Cato, when, on the day before the calends of May [30th of April], it was destroyed in the Social War by L. Sulla the legatus, and all that now stands on its site is a single farmhouse. Here also Taurania has ceased to exist, and the remains of Casilinum<@158> are fast going to ruin. Besides these, we learn from Antias that king L. Tarquinius took Apiolæ<@159>, a town of the Latins, and with its spoils laid the first foundations of the Capitol. From Surrentum<@160> to the river Silarus<@161>, the former territory of Picentia<@162> extends for a distance of thirty miles. This belonged to the Etruscans, and was remarkable for the temple of the Argive Juno, founded by Jason<@163>. In it was Picentia, a town<@164> of the territory of Salernum<@165>."

This city was finally destroyed in the wars of the Greeks and Lombards, and the modern Avellino rose on its site. There are considerable ruins in the vicinity. According to Hardouin, this place also claimed the honour of giving name to filberts, which grew abundantly in its vicinity.

Gracchus, and probably the old inhabitants for that reason styled themselves \"Veteres.\" The ruins at San Giovanni in Cerico, about three miles from Falvaterra, are supposed to be those of this place, or at least of the new town or colony. In such case Falvaterra may occupy the site of the original city.",
      "100": "The people of Ficulnea or Ficulia, a city of ancient Latium, on the Via Nomentana. It is supposed to have decayed soon after the reign of M. Aurelius.

Its site, though uninhabited, is still called Terame, and there are numerous remains of antiquity.",

      "122": "The name probably by which the city was called in the mystical language of the priesthood. It has been said that this mysterious name of Rome was Valentia; if so, it appears to be only a translation of her name Græcized—῾ρώμη, \"strength.\" This subject will be found again mentioned in B. xxviii. c. 4.",

We may also remark that the camp of the Prætorian cohorts here mentioned was established by the emperor Tiberius, by the advice of Sejanus.

      "134": "A town of Latium destroyed by Ancus Martius.",
      "135": "An ancient city of Latium, conquered by Romulus; on which occasion he slew its king Acron and gained the spolia opima. Nibby suggests that it stood on the Magugliano, two miles south-east of Monte Gentile. Holstein says that it stood where the present Sant' Angelo or Monticelli stands.",
      "136": "Also destroyed by Ancus Martius. A farm called Dragonello, eleven miles from Rome, is supposed to have stood upon its site. Tellene was also destroyed by the same king. Tifata was a town of Campania.",

      "141": "Said to have been so called from being \"opposite\" to the ancient city of Saturnia. The Janiculus or Janiculum was a fortress on the opposite bank of the Tiber, and a suburb of Rome, connected with it by the Sublician bridge.",
      "142": "A very ancient city situate three miles from Rome, and said to have been so called from its position on the Tiber, ante amnem. In the time of Strabo it had become a mere village. It stood at the confluence of the Anio and the Tiber.",

      "144": "An ancient city of Latium. It probably gradually fell into decay. Lucius Tarquinius, the husband of Lucretia, is represented as dwelling here during the siege of Ardea. Its site is thought by some to have been at Castellaccio or Castel dell' Osa, and by others at Lunghezza, which is perhaps the most probable conjecture.",
      "145": "An ancient city of the Sabines. Its ruins are visible at San Vittorino, a village near Aquila.",
      "146": "An ancient town of the Volsci, five leagues from Velletri. Sermonata now stands on its site. It must not be confounded with the town of the Peligni, the birth-place of Ovid.",
      "147": "\"Populi Albenses.\" It does not appear to be exactly known what is the force of this expression, but he probably means either colonies from Alba, or else nations who joined in the confederacy of which Alba was the principal. Niebuhr looks upon them as mere demi or boroughs of the territory of Alba.",
      "148": "\"Accipere carnem.\" Literally, \"to take the flesh.\" It appears that certain nations, of which Alba was the chief, were in early times accustomed to meet on the Alban Mount for the purposes of sacrifice. The subject is full of obscurity, but it has been suggested that this minor confederacy co-existed with a larger one including all the Latin cities, and there can be little doubt that the common sacrifice was typical of a bond of union among the states that partook therein. It does not necessarily appear from the context that more than the thirty-one states after mentioned took part therein, though the text may be so construed as to imply that the Latin nations previously mentioned also shared in the sacrifice; if so, it would seem to imply that Alba was the chief city of the whole Latin confederacy. See this subject ably discussed in Dr. Smith's Dictionary of Ancient Geography, under the article Latini.",

      "151": "Bola was an ancient city of Latium, taken successively by Coriolanus and M. Postumius. Its site is supposed to have been five miles from the modern Palestrina, at the modern village of Lugnano.",
      "152": "The people of Corioli. It was probably a Latian town, but fell into the possession of the Volsci, from whom it was taken by Cn. Marcius, who thence obtained the name of \"Coriolanus.\" Monte Giove, nineteen miles from Rome, has been suggested as its site.",
      "153": "Pliny is supposed to be in error in representing Fidenæ, the early antagonist of Rome, as being extinct in his time, and he will be found in the sequel reckoning it in the Fourth Region. This ancient Latian town never lost its municipal rank, though it had no doubt in his time become a mere country town. The present Castel Giubileo is supposed to be situate on its site.",

      "157": "This was an ancient town between Pompeii and Surrentum. After its overthrow, as mentioned by Pliny, it was in some measure rebuilt, possibly after this passage was penned. It was finally destroyed by the great eruption of Vesuvius in the year A.D. 79, and it was here that our author breathed his last.",
      "158": "A town three miles west of Capua. It was of much importance as a military position, and played a considerable part in the second Punic war. The period of its final destruction is unknown; but modern Capua is built on its site.",
      "159": "This city took the lead in the war of the Latin cities against Tarquinius Priscus. Gell and Nibby think that it was situate about eleven miles from Rome, a mile to the south of the Appian way, where there are some remains that indicate the site of an ancient city, near the stream called the Fosso delle Fratocche. Livy tells us that with the spoils thence derived, Tarquinius celebrated the Ludi Magni for the first time.",

      "162": "A town in the south of Campania, at the head of the Gulf of Pæstum. In consequence of the aid which they gave to Hannibal, the inhabitants were forced to abandon their town and live in the adjoining villages. The name of Picentini was given, as here stated, to the inhabitants of all the territory between the Promontory of Minerva and the river Silarus. They were a portion of the Sabine Picentes, who were transplanted thither after the conquest of Picenum, B.C. 268. The modern Vicenza stands on its site.",
      "163": "The Argonaut. Probably this was only a vague tradition.",
      "164": "By using the genitive 'Salerni,' he would seem to imply that the Roman colony of Salernum then gave name to the district of which Picentia was the chief town. Ajasson however has translated it merely \"Salernum and Picentia.\" 'Intus' can hardly mean \"inland,\" as Picentia was near the coast, and so was Salernum.",
      "165": "This was an ancient town of Campania, at the innermost corner of the Gulf of Pæstum, situate near the coast, on a height at the foot of which lay its harbour. It attained great prosperity, as Salerno, in the middle ages, and was noted for its School of Health established there; which issued periodically rules for the preservation of health in Latin Leonine verse."

    "paragraphs": [
      "At the Silarus begins the third region of Italy, consisting of the territory of Lucania and Bruttium; here too there have been no few changes of the population. These districts have been possessed by the Pelasgi, the Œnotrii, the Itali, the Morgetes, the Siculi, and more especially by people who emigrated from Greece<@1>, and, last of all, by the Leucani, a people sprung from the Samnites, who took possession under the command of Lucius. We find here the town of Pæstum<@2>, which received from the Greeks the name of Posidonia, the Gulf of Pæstum<@3>, the town of Elea, now known as Velia<@4>, and the Promontory of Palinurum<@5>, a point at which the land falls inwards and forms a bay<@6>, the distance across which to the pillar<@7> of Rhegium is 100 miles. Next after Palinurum comes the river Melpes<@8>, then the town of Buxentum<@9>, called in [Magna] Græcia Pyxus, and the river Laus; there was formerly a town<@10> also of the same name.",
      "At this spot begins the coast of Bruttium, and we come to the town of Blanda<@11>, the river Batum<@12>, Parthenius, a port of the Phocians, the bay of Vibo<@13>, the place<@14> where Clampetia formerly stood, the town of Temsa<@15>, called Temese by the Greeks, and Terina founded by the people of Crotona<@16>, with the extensive Gulf of Terina; more inland, the town of Consentia<@17>. Situate upon a peninsula<@18> is the river Acheron<@19>, from which the people of Acherontia derive the name of their town; then Hippo, now called Vibo Valentia, the Port of Hercules<@20>, the river Metaurus<@21>, the town of Tauroentum<@22>, the Port of Orestes, and Medma<@23>. Next, the town of Scyllæum<@24>, the river Cratæis<@25>, the mother of Scylla it is said; then the Pillar of Rhegium, the Straits of Sicily, and the two promontories which face each other, Cænys<@26> on the Italian, and Pelorus<@27> on the Sicilian side, the distance between them being twelve stadia. At a distance thence of twelve miles and a half, we come to Rhegium<@28>, after which begins Sila<@29>, a forest of the Apennines, and then the pro- montory of Leucopetra<@30>, at a distance of fifteen miles; after which come the Locri<@31>, who take their surname from the promontory of Zephyrium<@32>, being distant from the river Silarus 303 miles.",
      "At this spot ends the first<@33> great Gulf of Europe; the seas in which bear the following names:—That from which it takes its rise is called the Atlantic, by some the Great Atlantic, the entrance of which is, by the Greeks, called Porthmos, by us the Straits of Gades. After its entrance, as far as it washes the coasts of Spain, it is called the Hispanian Sea, though some give it the name of the Iberian or Balearic<@34> Sea. Where it faces the province of Gallia Narbonensis it has the name of the Gallic, and after that, of the Ligurian, Sea. From Liguria to the island of Sicily, it is called the Tuscan Sea, the same which is called by some of the Greeks the Notian<@35>, by others the Tyrrhenian, while many of our people call it the Lower Sea. Beyond Sicily, as far as the country of the Salentini, it is styled by Polybius the Ausonian Sea. Eratosthenes however gives to the whole expanse that lies between the inlet of the ocean and the island of Sardinia, the name of the Sardoan Sea; thence to Sicily, the Tyrrhenian; thence to Crete, the Sicilian; and beyond that island, the Cretan Sea."

It has the following towns; Palma<@13> and Pollentia<@14>, enjoying the rights of Roman citizens, Cinium<@15> and Tucis, with Latin rights: Bocchorum, a federate town, is no longer in existence. At thirty miles' distance is the smaller island, 40 miles in length, and 150<@16> in circumference; it contains the states of Jamnon<@17>, Sanisera, and Magon<@18>.",
      "In the open sea, at twelve miles' distance from the larger island, is Capraria<@19> with its treacherous coast, so notorious for its numerous shipwrecks; and, opposite to the city of Palma, are the islands known as the Mænariæ<@20>, Tiquadra<@21>, and Little Hannibalis<@22>.",

The Greeks have given it the name of Ophiusa<@23>. Ebusus too produces no<@24> rabbits to destroy the harvests of the Baleares. There are also about twenty other small islands in this sea, which is full of shoals. Off the coast of Gaul, at the mouth of the Rhodanus, there is Metina<@25>, and near it the island which is known as Blascon<@26>, with the three Stœchades, so called by their neighbours the Massilians<@27>, on account of the regular order in which they are placed; their respective names are Prote<@28>, Mese<@29>, also called Pomponiana, and Hypæa<@30>.

Between Pausilipum<@17> and Neapolis lies the island of Megaris<@18>, and then, at a distance of eight miles from Surrentum, Capreæ<@19>, famous for the castle of the emperor Tiberius: it is eleven miles in circumference."

      "But more celebrated than all is Sicily, called Sicania by Thucydides, and by many writers Trinacria or Trinacia, from its triangular appearance. According to Agrippa it is 618<@1> miles in circumference. In former times it was a continuation of the territory of Bruttium, but, in consequence of the overflowing of the sea, became severed from it; thus forming a strait of 15 miles in length, and a mile and a half in width in the vicinity of the Pillar of Rhegium. It was from this circumstance of the land being severed asunder that the Greeks gave the name of Rhegium<@2> to the town situate on the Italian shore.",
      "In these Straits is the rock of Scylla, as also Charybdis<@3>, a whirlpool of the sea, both of them noted for their perils. Of this triangle, the promontory, which, as we have already<@4> mentioned, is called Pelorus, faces Scylla and juts out towards Italy, while Pachynum<@5> extends in the direction of Greece, Peloponnesus being at a distance from it of 440 miles, and Lilybæum<@6>, towards Africa, being distant 180 miles from the promontory of Mercury<@7>, and from that of Caralis in Sardinia 190. These promontories and sides are situate at the following distances from each other: by land it is 186 miles from Pelorus to Pachynum, from Pachynum to Lilybæum 200, and from Lilybæum to Pelorus 170<@8>.",
      "In this island there are five colonies and sixty-three cities or states. Leaving Pelorus and facing the Ionian Sea, we have the town of Messana<@9>, whose inhabitants are also called Mamertini and enjoy the rights of Roman citizens; the promontory of Drepanum<@10>, the colony of Tauromenium<@11>, formerly called Naxos, the river Asines<@12>, and Mount Ætna, wondrous for the flames which it emits by night. Its crater is twenty stadia in circumference, and from it red-hot cinders are thrown as far as Tauromenium and Catina, the noise being heard even at Maroneum<@13> and the Gemellian Hills. We then come to the three rocks of the Cyclopes<@14>, the Port of Ulysses<@15>, the colony of Catina<@16>, and the rivers Symæthus<@17> and Terias; while more inland lie the Læstrygonian Plains.",
      "To these rivers succeed the towns of Leontinum<@18> and Megaris, the river Pantagies<@19>, the colony of Syracuse<@20>, with the fountain of Arethusa<@21>, (the people in the Syracusan ter- ritory drink too of the fountains of Temenitis<@22>, Archidemia, Magæa, Cyane, and Milichie,) the port of Naustathmus<@23>, the river Elorus, and the promontory of Pachynum. This side<@24> of Sicily begins with the river Hirminius<@25>, then follow the town of Camarina<@26>, the river Gelas<@27>, and the town of Agragas<@28>, which our people have named Agrigentum. We next come to the colony of Thermæ<@29>, the rivers Achates<@30>, Mazara, and Hypsa; the town of Selinus<@31>, and then the Promontory of Lilybæum, which is succeeded by Drepana<@32>, Mount Eryx<@33>, the towns of Panhormus<@34>, Solus<@35> and Himera<@36>, with a river of the same name, Cephalœdis<@37>, Aluntium<@38>, Agathyrnum, the colony of Tyndaris<@39>, the town of Mylæ<@40>, and then Pelorus, the spot at which we began.",
      "In the interior there are the following towns enjoying Latin privileges, those of the Centuripini<@41>, the Netini<@42>, and the Segestani<@43>; tributary towns are those of the Assorini<@44>, the Ætnenses<@45>, the Agyrini<@46>, the Acestæi, the Acrenses<@47>, the Bidini<@48>, the Cetarini<@49>, the Cacyrini<@50>, the Drepanitani, the Ergetini<@51>, the Echetlienses<@52>, the Erycini<@53>, the Entellini<@54>, the Enini<@55>, the Enguini<@56>, the Gelani<@57>, the Gala- tini<@58>, the Halesini<@59>, the Hennenses, the Hyblenses<@60>, the Herbitenses<@61>, the Herbessenses<@62>, the Herbulenses, the Halicyenses<@63>, the Hadranitani<@64>, the Imacarenses, the Ipanenses, the Ietenses<@65>, the Mytistratini<@66>, the Magellini, the Murgentini<@67>, the Mutycenses<@68>, the Menanini<@69>, the Naxii<@70>, the Noæi<@71>, the Petrini<@72>, the Paropini<@73>, the Phthinthienses<@74>, the Semellitani, the Scherini, the Selinuntii<@75>, the Symæthii, the Talarienses, the Tissinenses<@76>, the Triocalini<@77>, the Tyraci- nenses, and the Zanclæi<@78>, a Messenian colony on the Straits of Sicily. Towards Africa, its islands are Gaulos<@79>, Melita, 87 miles from Camerina, and 113 from Lilybæum, Cosyra<@80>, Hieronnesos<@81>, Cæne<@82>, Galata<@83>, Lopadusa, Æthusa, written by some Ægusa, Bucinna<@84>, Osteodes<@85>, distant from Soluntum 75 miles, and, opposite to Paropus, Ustica.",
      "On this side of Sicily, facing the river Metaurus, at a di- stance of nearly 25<@86> miles from Italy, are the seven<@87> islands called the Æolian, as also the Liparæan islands; by the Greeks they are called the Hephæstiades, and by our writers the Vulcanian<@88> Isles; they are called \"Æolian\" because in the Trojan times Æolus was king there.",
      "(9.) Lipara<@89>, with a town whose inhabitants enjoy the rights of Roman citizens, is so called from Liparus, a former king who succeeded<@90> Æolus, it having been previously called Melogonis or Meligunis. It is 25 miles<@91> distant from Italy, and in circumference a little less. Between this island and Sicily we find another, the name of which was formerly Therasia, but now called Hiera, because it is sacred to Vulcan<@92>: it contains a hill which at night vomits forth flames. The third island is Strongyle<@93>, lying one mile<@94> to the east of Lipara, over which Æolus reigned as well; it differs only from Lipara in the superior brilliancy of its flames. From the smoke of this volcano it is said that some of the inhabitants are able to predict three days beforehand what winds are about to blow; hence arose the notion that the winds are governed by Æolus. The fourth of these islands is Didyme<@95>, smaller than Lipara, the fifth Ericusa, the sixth Phœnicusa, left to be a pasture-ground for the cattle of the neighbouring islands, and the last and smallest Euonymos. Thus much as to the first great Gulf of Europe."

    "paragraphs": [
      "At Locri begins the fore-part of Italy, called Magna Græcia, whose coast falls back in three bays<@1> formed by the Ausonian sea, so called from the Ausones, who were the first inhabitants of the country. According to Varro it is 86 miles in extent; but most writers have made it only 75. Along this coast there are rivers innumerable, but we shall mention those only that are worthy of remark. After leaving Locri we come to the Sagra<@2>, and the ruins of the town of Caulon, Mystiæ<@3>, Consilinum Castrum<@4>, Cocinthum<@5>, in the opinion of some, the longest headland of Italy, and then the Gulf of Scylacium<@6>, and Scylacium<@7> itself, which was called by the Athenians, when they founded it, Scylletium. This part of Italy is nearly a peninsula, in consequence of the Gulf of Terinæum<@8> running up into it on the other side; in it there is a harbour called Castra Hannibalis<@9>: in no part is Italy narrower than here, it being but twenty miles across. For this reason the Elder Dionysius entertained the idea of severing<@10> this portion from the main-land of Italy at this spot, and adding it to Sicily. The navigable rivers in this district are the Carcines<@11>, the Crotalus, the Semirus, the Arocas, and the Targines. In the interior is the town of Petilia<@12>, and there are besides, Mount Clibanus<@13>, the promontory of Lacinium, in front of which lies the island of Dioscoron<@14>, ten miles from the main-land, and another called the Isle of Calypso, which Homer is supposed to refer to under the name of Ogygia; as also the islands of Tiris, Eranusa, and Meloessa. According to Agrippa, the promontory of Lacinium<@15> is seventy miles from Caulon.",
      "(11.) At the promontory of Lacinium begins the second Gulf of Europe, the bend of which forms an are of great depth, and terminates at Acroceraunium, a promontory of Epirus, from which it is distant<@16> seventy-five miles. We first come to the town of Croton<@17>, and then the river Neæthus<@18>, and the town of Thurii<@19>, situate between the two rivers Crathis and Sybaris, upon the latter of which there was once a city<@20> of the same name. In a similar manner Heraclia<@21>, sometimes called Siris, lies between the river of that name and the Aciris. We next come to the rivers Acalandrus and Casuentum<@22>, and the town of Metapontum<@23>, with which the third region of Italy terminates. In the interior of Bruttium, the Aprustani<@24> are the only people; but in Lucania we find the Atinates, the Bantini, the Eburini<@25>, the Grumentini, the Potentini, the Sontini<@26>, the Sirini, the Tergilani, the Ursentini, and the Volcentani<@27>, whom the Numestrani join. Besides these, we learn from Cato<@28> that Thebes in Lucania has disappeared, and Theopompus informs us that there was formerly a city of the Lucani called Pandosia<@29>, at which Alexander, the king of Epirus, died."

    "chapter_name": "CHAP. 16.—THE SECOND REGION OF ITALY.",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Adjoining to this district is the second region of Italy, which embraces the Hirpini, Calabria, Apulia, and the Salentini, extending a distance of 250 miles along the Gulf of Tarentum, which receives its name from a town of the Laconians so called, situate at the bottom of the Gulf; to which was annexed the maritime colony which had previously settled there. Tarentum<@1> is distant from the promontory of Lacinium 136 miles, and throws out the territory of Calabria opposite to it in the form of a peninsula. The Greeks called this territory Messapia, from their leader<@2>; before which it was called Peucetia, from Peucetius<@3>, the brother of Œnotrius, and was comprised in the territory of Salentinum. Between the two promontories<@4> there is a distance of 100 miles. The breadth across the peninsula from Tarentum<@5> to Brundusium by land is 35 miles, considerably less if measured from the port of Sasina<@6>. The towns inland from Tarentum are Varia<@7> surnamed Apulia, Messapia, and Aletium<@8>; on the coast, Senum, and Callipolis<@9>, now known as Anxa, 75 miles from Tarentum. Thence, at a distance of 32 miles, is the Pro- montory of Acra Iapygia<@10>, at which point Italy projects the greatest distance into the sea. At a distance of 19 miles from this point is the town of Basta<@11>, and then Hydruntum<@12>, the spot at which the Ionian is separated from the Adriatic sea, and from which the distance across to Greece is the shortest. The town of the Apolloniates<@13> lies opposite to it, and the breadth of the arm of the sea which runs between is not more than fifty miles. Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, was the first who entertained the notion of uniting these two points and making a passage on foot, by throwing a bridge across, and after him M. Varro<@14>, when commanding the fleet of Pompey in the war against the Pirates. Other cares however prevented either of them from accomplishing this design. Passing Hydruntum, we come to the deserted site of Soletum<@15>, then Fratuertium, the Portus Tarentinus, the haven of Miltopa, Lupia<@16>, Balesium<@17>, Cælia<@18>, and then Brundusium<@19>, fifty miles from Hydruntum. This last place is one of the most famous .ports of Italy, and, although more distant, affords by far the safest passage across to Greece, the place of disembarkation being Dyrrachium, a city of Illyria; the distance across is 225 miles.",
      "Adjoining Brundusium is the territory of the Pediculi<@20>; nine youths and as many maidens, natives of Illyria, became the parents of sixteen nations. The towns of the Pediculi are Rudiæ<@21>, Egnatia<@22>, and Barium<@23>; their rivers are the Iapyx (so called from the son of Dædalus, who was king there, and who gave it the name of Iapygia), the Pactius<@24>, and the Aufidus, which rises in the Hirpinian mountains and flows past Canusium<@25>.",
      "At this point begins Apulia, surnamed the Daunian, from the Daunii, who take their name from a former chief, the father-in-law of Diomedes. In this territory are the towns of Salapia<@26>, famous for Hannibal's amour with a courtezan, Sipontum<@27>, Uria, the river Cerbalus<@28>, forming the boundary of the Daunii, the port of Agasus<@29>, and the Promontory of Mount Garganus<@30>, distant from the Promontory of Salentinum or Iapygia 234 miles. Making the circuit of Garganus, we come to the port of Garna<@31>, the Lake Pantanus<@32>, the river Frento, the mouth of which forms a harbour, Teanum of the Apuli<@33>, and Larinum, Cliternia<@34>, and the river Tifernus, at which the district of the Frentani<@35> begins. Thus there were three different nations of the Apulians, [the Daunii,] the Teani, so called from their leader, and who sprang from the Greeks, and the Lucani, who were subdued by Calchas<@36>, and whose country is now possessed by the Atinates. Besides those already mentioned, there are, of the Daunii, the colonies of Luceria<@37> and Venusia<@38>, the towns of Canusium<@39> and Arpi, formerly called Argos Hippium<@40> and founded by Diomedes, afterwards called Argyrippa. Here too Diomedes destroyed the nations of the Monadi and the Dardi, and the two cities of Apina and Trica<@41>, whose names have passed into a by-word and a proverb.",
      "Besides the above, there is in the interior of the second region one colony of the Hirpini, Beneventum<@42>, so called by an exchange of a more auspicious name for its old one of Maleventum; also the Æculani<@43>, the Aquilonii<@44>, the Abellinates surnamed Protropi, the Compsani, the Caudini, the Ligures, both those called the Corneliani and Bebiani, the Vescellani, the Æclani, the Aletrini, the Abellinates<@45> surnamed Marsi, the Atrani, the Æcani<@46>, the Alfellani<@47>, the Atinates<@48>, the Arpani, the Borcani, the Collatni, the Cori- nenses, the Cannenses<@49>, rendered famous by the defeat of the Romans, the Dirini, the Forentani<@50>, the Genusini<@51>, the Herdo- nienses, the Hyrini<@52>, the Larinates surnamed Frentani<@53>, the Merinates<@54> of Garganus, the Mateolani, the Netini<@55>, the Ru- bustini<@56>, the Silvini<@57>, the Strapellini<@58>, the Turmentini, the Vibinates<@59>, the Venusini, and the Ulurtini. In the interior of Calabria there are the Ægetini, the Apamestini<@60>, the Argentini, the Butuntinenses<@61>, the Deciani, the Grumbestini, the Norbanenses, the Palionenses, the Sturnini<@62>, and the Tutini: there are also the following Salentine nations; the Aletini<@63>, the Basterbini<@64>, the Neretini, the Uxentini, and the Veretini<@65>."

The same story is referred to by Pliny, B. ii. c. 111, where he incorrectly makes Egnatia a town of the Salentini.

      "We now come to the fourth region, which includes the most valiant probably of all the nations of Italy. Upon the coast, in the territory of the Frentani<@1>, after the river Tifernus, we find the river Trinium<@2>, with a good harbour at its mouth, the towns of Histonium<@3>, Buca<@4>, and Ortona, and the river Aternus<@5>. In the interior are the Anxani surnamed Frentani, the Higher and Lower Carentini<@6>, and the Lanuenses; in the territory of the Marrucini, the Teatini<@7>; in that of the Peligni, the Corfinienses<@8>, the Superæquani<@9>, and the Sulmonenses<@10>; in that of the Marsi, the Anxantini<@11>, the Atinates<@12>, the Fucentes<@13>, the Lucenses<@14>, and the Marruvini<@15>; in that of the Albenses, the town of Alba on Lake Fucinus; in that of the Æquiculani, the Cliternini<@16>, and the Carseolani<@17>; in that of the Vestini, the Angulani<@18>, the Pinnenses, and the Peltuinates, adjoining to whom are the Aufinates<@19> Cismontani; in that of the Samnites, who have been called Sabelli<@20>, and whom the Greeks have called Saunitæ, the colony of old Bovianum<@21>, and that of the Undecumani, the Aufidenates<@22>, the Esernini<@23>, the Fagifulani, the Ficolenses<@24>, the Sæpinates<@25>, and the Tereventinates; in that of the Sabini, the Amiternini<@26>, the Curenses<@27>, Forum Decî<@28>, Forum Novum, the Fidenates, the Interamnates<@29>, the Nursini<@30>, the Nomentani<@31>, the Reatini<@32>, the Trebulani, both those called Mutusci<@33> and those called Suffenates<@34>, the Tiburtes, and the Tarinates.",
      "In these districts, the Comini<@35>, the Tadiates, the Cædici, and the Alfaterni, tribes of the Æquiculi, have disappeared. From Gellianus we learn that Archippe<@36>, a town of the Marsi, built by Marsyas, a chieftain of the Lydians, has been swallowed up by Lake Fucinus, and Valerianus informs us that the town of the Viticini in Picenum was destroyed by the Romans. The Sabini (called, according to some writers, from their attention to religious<@37> observances and the worship of the gods, Sevini) dwell on the dew-clad hills in the vicinity of the Lakes of the Velinus<@38>. The Nar, with its sulphureous waters, exhausts these lakes, and, descending from Mount Fiscellus<@39>, unites with them near the groves of Vacuna<@40> and Reate, and then directs its course towards the Tiber, into which it discharges itself. Again, in another direction, the Anio<@41>, taking its rise in the mountain of the Trebani, carries into the Tiber the waters of three lakes remarkable for their picturesque beauty, and to which Subla- queum<@42> is indebted for its name. In the territory of Reate is the Lake of Cutiliæ<@43>, in which there is a floating island, and which, according to M. Varro, is the navel or central point of Italy. Below the Sabine territory lies that of La- tium, on one side Picenum, and behind it Umbria, while the range of the Apennines flanks it on either side."

The lake still exists, but the floating island has disappeared. There are some fine ruins of Roman baths in the vicinity of the lake."

It is probable that in early times human sacrifices were the consequence; but at a later period the following custom was adopted instead. The children were allowed to grow up, and in the spring of their twentieth or twenty-first year were with covered faces driven across the frontier of their native country, to go whithersoever chance or the guidance of the deity might lead them.

    "chapter_name": "CHAP. 20. (15.)—THE EIGHTH REGION OF ITALY; THE PADUS.",
    "paragraphs": [
      "The eighth region is bounded by Ariminum, the Padus, and the Apennines. Upon the coast we have the river Crustumium<@1>, and the colony of Ariminum<@2>, with the rivers Ariminus and Aprusa. Next comes the river Rubico<@3>, once the boundary of Italy, and after it the Sapis<@4>, the Vitis, and the Anemo, and then, Ravenna, a town of the Sabines<@5>, with the river Bedesis, 105 miles from Ancona; and, not far from the sea, Butrium<@6>, a town of the Umbri. In the interior there are the colonies of Bononia<@7>, formerly called Felsina, when it was the chief place of Etruria<@8>, Brixillum<@9>, Mutina<@10>, Parma<@11>, and Placentia<@12>. There are also the towns of Cæsena<@13>, Claterna, Forum Clodî<@14>, Forum Livî, Forum Popilî, Forum Truentinorum<@15>, Forum Cornelî, Forum Licinî, the Faventini<@16>, the Fidentini<@17>, the Otesini, the Padinates<@18>, the Regi- enses<@19>, who take their name from Lepidus, the Solonates<@20>, the Saltus Galliani<@21>, surnamed Aquinates, the Tannetani<@22>, the Veliates<@23>, who were anciently surnamed Regiates, and the Urbanates<@24>. In this district the Boii<@25> have disappeared, of whom there were 112 tribes according to Cato; as also the Senones, who captured Rome.",
      "(16.) The Padus<@26> descends from the bosom of Mount Vesulus, one of the most elevated points of the chain of the Alps, in the territories of the Ligurian Vagienni<@27>, and rises at its source in a manner that well merits an inspection by the curious; after which it hides itself in a subterranean channel until it rises again in the country of the Forovibienses. It is inferior in fame to none whatever among the rivers, being known to the Greeks as the Eridanus and famous as the scene of the punishment of Phaëton<@28>. At the rising of the Dog-star it is swollen by the melted snows; but, though it proves more furious in its course to the adjoining fields than to the vessels that are upon it, still it takes care to carry away no portion of its banks, and when it recedes, renders them additionally fertile. Its length from its source is 300 miles, to which we must add eighty-eight for its sinuosities; and it receives from the Apennines and Alps not only several navigable rivers, but immense lakes as well, which discharge themselves into its waters, thus conveying altogether as many as thirty streams into the Adriatic Sea.",
      "Of these the best known are the following—flowing from the range of the Apennines, the Jactus, the Tanarus<@29>, the Trebia which passes Placentia, the Tarus, the Incia, the Gabellus, the Scultenna, and the Rhenus: from the chain of the Alps, the Stura<@30>, the Orgus, the two Duriæ, the Sessites, the Ticinus, the Lambrus, the Addua, the Ollius, and the Mincius. There is no river known to receive a larger increase than this in so short a space; so much so indeed that it is impelled onwards by this vast body of water, and, invading the land<@31>, forms deep channels in its course: hence it is that, although a portion of its stream is drawn off by rivers and canals between Ravenna and Altinum, for a space of 120 miles, still, at the spot where it discharges the vast body of its waters, it is said to form seven seas.",
      "By the Augustan Canal the Padus is carried to Ravenna, at which place it is called the Padusa<@32>, having formerly borne the name of Messanicus. The nearest mouth to this spot forms the extensive port known as that of Vatrenus, where Claudius Cæsar<@33>, on his triumph over the Britons, entered the Adriatic in a vessel that deserved rather the name of a vast palace than a ship. This mouth, which was formerly called by some the Eridanian, has been by others styled the Spinetic mouth, from the city of Spina, a very powerful place which formerly stood in the vicinity, if we may form a conclusion from the amount of its treasure deposited at Delphi; it was founded by Diomedes. At this spot the river Vatrenus<@34>, which flows from the territory of Forum Corneli, swells the waters of the Padus.",
      "The next mouth to this is that of Caprasia<@35>, then that of Sagis, and then Volane, formerly called Olane; all of which are situate upon the Flavian Canal<@36>, which the Tuscans formerly made from Sagis, thus drawing the impetuous stream of the river across into the marshes of the Atriani, which they call the Seven Seas; and upon which is the noble port of Atria<@37>, a city of the Tuscans, from which place the sea was formerly called the Atriatic, though now the Adriatic.",
      "We next come to the overflowing mouths of Carbonaria, and the Fosses of Philistina<@38>, by some called Tarta- rus<@39>, all of which originate in the overflow of the waters in the Philistinian Canal, swollen by the streams of the Atesis, descending from the Tridentine Alps, and of the Togisonus<@40>, flowing from the territory of the Patavini. A portion of them also forms the adjoining port of Brundulum<@41>, in the same manner as Edron<@42> is formed by the two rivers Meduacus and the Clodian Canal. With the waters of these streams the Padus unites, and with them discharges itself into the sea, forming, according to most writers, between the Alps and the sea-shore a triangular figure, 2000 stadia in circumference, not unlike the Delta formed by the Nile in Egypt. I feel somewhat ashamed to have to borrow from the Greeks any statement in reference to Italy; Metrodorus of Scepsos, however, informs us that this river has obtained its name of Padus from the fact, that about its source there are great numbers of pine-trees, which in the Gallic language are called \"padi.\" In the tongue of the Ligurians this river is called \"Bodincus,\" which signifies \"the bottomless.\" This derivation is in some measure supported by the fact that near this river there is the town of Industria<@43>, of which the ancient name was Bodincomagum, and where the river begins to be of greater depth than in other parts."

They were ultimately driven from their settlements, and established themselves in the modern Bohemia, which from them takes its name.

That this region takes its name from the river Ister which flows from the Danube, also called the Ister, into the Adriatic opposite the mouth of the Padus, and that the sea which lies between them is rendered fresh by their waters running from opposite directions, has been erroneously asserted by many, and among them by Nepos even, who dwelt upon the banks of the Padus. For it is the fact that no river which runs from the Danube discharges itself into the Adriatic. They have been misled, I think, by the circumstance that the ship Argo came down some river into the Adriatic sea, not far from Tergeste; but what river that was is now unknown. The most careful writers say that the ship was carried across the Alps on men's shoulders, having passed along the Ister, then along the Savus, and so from Nauportus<@18>, which place, lying between Æmona<@19> and the Alps, from that circumstance derives its name."

      "Istria projects in the form of a peninsula. Some writers have stated its length to be forty miles, and its circumference 125; and the same as to Liburnia which adjoins it, and the Flanatic Gulf<@1>, while others make it 225<@2>; others again make the circumference of Liburnia 180 miles. Some persons too extend Iapydia, at the back of Istria, as far as the Flanatic Gulf, a distance of 130 miles, thus making Liburnia but 150 miles. Tuditanus<@3>, who subdued the Istri, had this inscription on his statue which was erected there: \"From Aquileia to the river Titus is a distance of 1000 stadia.\"",
      "The towns of Istria with the rights of Roman citizens are Ægida<@4>, Parentium, and the colony of Pola<@5>, now Pietas Julia, formerly founded by the Colchians, and distant from Tergeste 100 miles: after which we come to the town of Nesactium<@6>, and the river Arsia, now<@7> the boundary of Italy. The distance across from Ancona to Pola is 120 miles. In the interior of the tenth region are the colonies of Cremona, Brixia in the territory of the Cenomanni<@8>, Ateste<@9> belonging to the Veneti, and the towns of Acelum<@10>, Patavium<@11>, Opitergium, Belunum<@12>, and Vicetia; with Mantua<@13>, the only city of the Tuscans now left beyond the Padus. Cato informs us that the Veneti are descendants of the Trojans<@14>, and that the Cenomanni<@15> dwelt among the Volcæ in the vicinity of Massilia. There are also the towns of the Fertini<@16>, the Tridentini<@17>, and the Beruenses, belonging to the Rhæti, Verona<@18>, belonging to the Rhæti and the Euganei, and Ju- lienses<@19> to the Carni. We then have the following peoples, whom there is no necessity to particularize with any degree of exactness, the Alutrenses, the Asseriates, the Flamonienses<@20> with those surnamed Vanienses, and the others called Culici, the Forojulienses<@21> surnamed Transpadani, the Foretani, the Nedinates<@22>, the Quarqueni<@23>, the Taurisani<@24>, the Togienses, and the Varvari. In this district there have disappeared—upon the coast—Iramene, Pellaon, and Palsatium, Atina and Cælina belonging to the Veneti, Segeste and Ocra to the Carni, and Noreia to the Taurisci. L. Piso also informs us that although the senate disapproved of his so doing, M. Claudius Marcellus<@25> razed to the ground a tower situate at the twelfth mile-stone from Aquileia.",
      "In this region also and the eleventh there are some celebrated lakes<@26>, and several rivers that either take their rise in them or else are fed by their waters, in those cases in which they again emerge from them. These are the Addua<@27>, fed by the Lake Larius, the Ticinus by Lake Verbannus, the Mincius by Lake Benacus, the Ollius by Lake Sebinnus, and the Lambrus by Lake Eupilis—all of them flowing into the Padus.",
      "Cælius states that the length of the Alps from the Upper Sea to the Lower is 1000 miles, a distance which Timagenes shortens by twenty-two. Cornelius Nepos assigns to them a breadth of 100 miles, and T. Livius of 3000 stadia; but then in different places. For in some localities they exceed 100 miles; where they divide Germany, for instance, from Italy; while in other parts they do not reach seventy, being thus narrowed by the providential dispensation of nature as it were. The breadth of Italy, taken from the river Var at the foot of these mountains, and passing along by the Vada<@28> Sabatia, the Taurini, Comum, Brixia, Verona, Vicetia, Opitergium, Aquileia, Tergeste, Pola, and Arsia, is 745 miles."

      "Many nations dwell among the Alps; but the more remarkable, between Pola and the district of Tergeste, are the Secusses, the Subocrini, the Catali, the Menocaleni, and near the Carni the people formerly called the Taurisci, but now the Norici. Adjoining to these are the Rhæti and the Vindelici, who are all divided into a multitude of states. It is supposed that the Rhæti are the descendants of the Tuscans, who were expelled by the Gauls and migrated hither under the command of their chief, whose name was Rhætus. Turning then to the side of the Alps which fronts Italy, we have the Euganean<@1> nations enjoying Latin rights, and of whom Cato enumerates thirty-four towns. Among these are the Triumpilini, a people who were sold<@2> with their territory; and then the Camuni, and several similar tribes, each of them in the jurisdiction of its neighbouring municipal town. The same author also considers the Lepontii<@3> and the Salassi to be of Tauriscan origin, but most other writers, giving a Greek<@4> interpretation to their name, consider the Lepontii to have been those of the followers of Hercules who were left behind in consequence of their limbs being frozen by the snow of the Alps. They are also of opinion that the inhabitants of the Grecian Alps are descended from a portion of the Greeks of his army, and that the Euganeans, being sprung from an origin so illustrious, thence took their name<@5>. The head of these are the Stœni<@6>. The Vennonenses<@7> and the Sarunetes<@8>, peoples of the Rhæti, dwell about the sources of the river Rhenus, while the tribe of the Lepontii, known as the Uberi, dwell in the vicinity of the sources of the lhodanus, in the same district of the Alps. There are also other native tribes here, who have received Latin rights, such as the Octodurenses<@9>, and their neighbours the Centrones<@10>, the Cottian<@11> states, the Ligurian Vagienni, descended from the Caturiges<@12>, as also those called Montani<@13>; besides numerous nations of the Capillati<@14>, on the confines of the Ligurian Sea.",
      "It may not be inappropriate in this place to subjoin the inscription now to be seen upon the trophy<@15> erected on the Alps, which is to the following effect:—\"To the Emperor Cæsar—The son<@16> of Cæsar now deified, Augustus, Pontifex Maximus, and emperor fourteen years, in the seventeenth<@17> year of his holding the tribuni- tial authority, the Senate and the Roman people, in remembrance that under his command and auspices all the Alpine nations which extended from the upper sea to the lower were reduced to subjection by the Roman people—The Alpine nations so sub- dued were: the Triumpilini, the Camuni, the Ve- nostes<@18>, the Vennonenses, the Isarci, the Breuni, the Genaunes<@19>, the Focunates, four nations of the Vindelici, the Consuanetes, the Rucinates, the Licates<@20>, the Catenates, the Ambisontes, the Ru- gusci, the Suanetes<@21>, the Calucones, the Brixentes, the Lepontii, the Uberi, the Nantuates, the Seduni, the Varagri, the Salassi, the Acitavones, the Medulli, the Uceni<@22>, the Caturiges, the Bri- giani, the Sogiontii, the Brodiontii, the Nemaloni, the Edenates<@23>, the Esubiani, the Veamini, the Gal- litæ, the Triulatti, the Ecdini, the Vergunni, the Eguituri<@24>, the Nementuri, the Oratelli, the Nerusi, the Velauni, and the Suetri.\"",

Varro states that eighty-nine states used to resort thither, but now nearly the only ones that are known are the Cerauni<@10> with 24 decuries, the Daorizi with 17, the Dæsitiates with 103, the Docleatæ with 33, the Deretini with 14, the Deremistæ with 30, the Dindari with 33, the Glinditiones with 44, the Melcomani with 24, the Naresii with 102, the Scirtarii with 72, the Siculotæ with 24, and the Vardæi, once the scourges of Italy, with no more than 20 decuries. In addition to these, this district was possessed by the Ozuæi, the Partheni, the Hemasini, the Arthitæ, and the Armistæ. The colony of Epidaurum<@11> is distant from the river Naron 100 miles. After Epidaurum come the following towns, with the rights of Roman citizens:—Rhizinium<@12>, Acruvium<@13>, Butua, Olcinium, formerly called Colchinium, having been founded by the Colchians; the river Drilo<@14>, and, upon it, Scodra<@15>, a town with the rights of Roman citizens, situate at a distance of eighteen miles from the sea; besides in former times many Greek towns and once powerful states, of which all remem- brance is fast fading away. For in this region there were formerly the Labeatæ, the Enderini<@16>, the Sasæi, the Grabæi<@17>, properly called Illyrii, the Taulantii<@18>, and the Pyrei. The Promontory of Nymphæum on the sea-coast still retains its name<@19>; and there is Lissum, a town enjoying the rights of Roman citizens, at a distance from Epidaurum of 100 miles.",
      "(23.) At Lissum begins the province of Macedonia<@20>, the nations of the Parthini<@21>, and behind them the Dassaretæ<@22>. The mountains of Candavia<@23> are seventy-eight miles from Dyrrhachium. On the coast lies Denda, a town with the rights of Roman citizens, the colony of Epidamnum<@24>, which, on account of its inauspicious name, was by the Romans called Dyrrhachium, the river Aöus<@25>, by' some called Æas, and Apollonia<@26>, formerly a colony of the Corinthians, at a distance of four miles from the sea, in the vicinity of which the celebrated Nymphæum<@27> is inhabited by the barbarous Amantes<@28> and Buliones. Upon the coast too is the town of Oricum<@29>, founded by the Colchians. At this spot begins Epirus, with the Acroceraunian<@30> mountains, by which we have previously mentioned<@31> this Gulf of Europe as bounded. Oricum is distant from the Promontory of Salentinum in Italy eighty<@32> miles."

He wrote works on the sites of the cities of Italy, the Nature of the Gods, an account of the Penates, an account of Virgil (probably the same as the work called \"Commentaries on Virgil\"), on the Families of Trojan descent, on Agriculture, the \"Propempticon Cinnæ,\" the Lives of Illustrious Men (quoted by John of Salisbury in his \"Polycraticon \"), a book of Examples, and a work on the Art of War, also mentioned by John of Salisbury. A book of Fables, and an Astronomical Poem, in four books, are ascribed to him, but they are probably productions of a later age.",

While commanding in Germany he formed the project of connecting the Moselle and the Saone by a canal, thus establishing a communication between the Mediterranean and the Northern Ocean. Nero having resolved on his death, he anticipated his sentence by opening his veins in a warm bath. His mother-in-law Sextia, and his daughter Pollentia, in a similar manner perished with him.",

He was the first Roman author who wrote a treatise on Geography. It is still extant, and bears marks of great care, while it is written in pure and unaffected language.",
      "27": "C. Scribonius Curio, the third known of that name. He was the first Roman general who advanced as far as the Danube. Like his son of the same name, he was a violent opponent of Julius Cæsar. He was eloquent as an orator, but ignorant and uncultivated. His orations were published, as also an invective against Cæsar, in form of a dialogue, in which his son was introduced as one of the interlocutors. He died B.C. 53.",

Ateius here mentioned was probably the person surnamed Prætextatus, and Philologus, a freedman of the jurist Ateius Capito. For Sallust the historian he composed an Abstract of Roman History, and for Asinius Pollio he compiled precepts on the Art of Writing. His Commentaries were numerous, but a few only were surviving in the time of Suetonius.",

Suidas states that he was a native of Ephesus and a disciple of Crates, and during the war of Sylla in Greece was made prisoner and sold as a slave to C. Lentulus, who made him the tutor of his children, and afterwards restored him to freedom. Servius however says that he received the franchise from L. Cornelius Sylla. He was burnt with his house at Laurentum. Other writers say that he was a native of Catiæum in Lesser Phrygia. The surname of \"Polyhistor\" was given to him for his prodigious learning. His greatest work seems to have been a historical and geographical account of the world, in forty-two books. Other works of his are frequently mentioned by Plutarch, Photius, and other writers.",

      "48": "Diodorus Siculus was a native of Agyra or Agyrium, and not of Syracuse, though lie may possibly have resided or studied there. It cannot be doubted that he is the person here meant, and Pliny refers in his preface by name to his βιβλιοθήκη, \"Library,\" or Universal History. A great portion of this miscellaneous but valuable work has perished. We have but few particulars of his life; but he is supposed to have written his work after B.C. 8.",
      "49": "Of Syracuse; an historian probably of the time of Philip and Alexander. He was the author of a Periplus of Asia, and an account of Sicily and Sardinia. From his stories in the last he obtained the name of \"Thaumatographus \"or \"writer of wonders.\"",

      "51": "Probably Timagenes, the rhetorician of Alexandria. He was taken prisoner and brought to Rome, but redeemed from captivity by Faustus, the son of Sylla. He wrote many works, but it is somewhat doubtful whether the \"Periplus,\" in five Books, was written by this Timagenes. He is also supposed to have written a work on the Antiquities of Gaul."

      "The third great Gulf of Europe begins at the mountains of Acroceraunia<@1>, and ends at the Hellespont, embracing an extent of 2500 miles, exclusive of the sea-line of nineteen smaller gulfs. Upon it are Epirus, Acarnania, Ætolia, Phocis, Locris, Achaia, Messenia, Laconia, Argolis, Megaris, Attica, Bœotia; and again, upon the other sea<@2>, the same Phocis and Locris, Doris, Phthiotis, Thessalia, Magnesia, Macedonia and Thracia. All the fabulous lore of Greece, as well as the effulgence of her literature, first shone forth upon the banks of this Gulf. We shall therefore dwell a little the longer upon it.",
      "Epirus<@3>, generally so called, begins at the mountains of Acroceraunia. The first people that we meet are the Chaones, from whom Chaonia<@4> receives its name, then the Thesproti<@5>, and then the Antigonenses<@6>. We then come to the place where Aornos<@7> stood, with its exhalations so deadly to the feathered race, the Cestrinis<@8>, the Perrhæbi<@9>, in whose coun- try Mount Pindus is situate, the Cassiopæi<@10>, the Dryopes<@11>, the Sellæ<@12>, the Hellopes<@13>, the Molossi, in whose territory is the temple of the Dodonæan Jupiter, so famous for its oracle; and Mount Tomarus<@14>, so highly praised by Theopompus, with its hundred springs gushing from its foot.",
      "(2.) Epirus, properly so called, advances towards Magnesia and Macedonia, having at its back the Dassaretæ, previously<@15> mentioned, a free nation, and after them the Dardani, a savage race. On the left hand, before the Dardani are extended the Triballi and the nations of Mœsia, while in front of them the Medi and the Denselatæ join, and next to them the Thracians, who stretch away as far as the Euxine: in such a manner is a rampart raised around the lofty heights of Rhodope, and then of Hæmus.",
      "On the coast of Epirus is the fortress of Chimær<@16>, situate upon the Acroceraunian range, and below it the spring known as the Royal Waters<@17>; then the towns of Mæandria, and Cestria<@18>, the Thyamis<@19>, a river of Thesprotia, the colony of Buthrotum<@20>, and the Ambracian Gulf<@21>, so famed in history; which, with an inlet only half a mile in width, receives a vast body of water from the sea, being thirty-seven miles in length, and fifteen in width. The river Acheron, which runs through Acherusia, a lake of Thesprotia, flows into it<@22> after a course of thirty-six miles; it is considered wonderful for its bridge, 1000 feet in length, by a people who look upon everything as wonderful that belongs to themselves. Upon this Gulf is also situate the town of Ambracia. There are also the Aphas and the Arachthus<@23>, rivers of the Molossi; the city of Anactoria<@24>, and the place where Pandosia<@25> stood."

Leake is of the same opinion as to the site of the town; but, as has been a subject of remark, it is the only place of celebrity in Greece of which the situation is not exactly known.

      "The Peloponnesus, which was formerly called Apia<@1> and Pelasgia, is a peninsula, inferior in fame to no land upon the face of the earth. Situate between the two seas, the Ægæan and the Ionian, it is in shape like the leaf of a plane-tree, in consequence of the angular indentations made in its shores. According to Isidorus, it is 563 miles in circumference; and nearly as much again, allowing for the sea-line on the margin of its gulfs. The narrow pass at which it commences is know by the name of the Isthmus. At this spot the two seas, which we have previously mentioned, running from the north and the east, invade the land from opposite sides<@2>, and swallow up its entire breadth, the result being that through these inroads in opposite directions of such vast bodies of water, the sides of the land are eaten away to such an extent, that Hellas<@3> only holds on to the Peloponnesus by the narrow neck, five miles in width, which intervenes. The Gulfs thus formed, the one on this side, the other on that, are known as the Corinthian<@4> and the Saronic Gulfs. The ports of Lecheæ<@5>, on the one side, and of Cenchreæ on the other, form the frontiers of this narrow passage, which thus compels to a tedious and perilous circumnavigation such vessels as from their magnitude cannot be carried across by land on vehicles. For this reason it is that both King Demetrius<@6>, Cæsar the Dictator, the prince Caius<@7>, and Domitius Nero<@8>, have at different times made the attempt to cut through this neck by forming a navigable canal; a profane design, as may be clearly seen by the result<@9> in every one of these instances.",
      "Upon the middle of this intervening neck which we have called the Isthmus, stands the colony of Corinth, formerly known by the name of Ephyre<@10>, situate upon the brow of a hill, at a distance of sixty stadia from the shore of either sea. From the heights of its citadel, which is called Acrocorinthos, or the \"Heights of Corinth,\" and in which is the Fountain of Pirene, it looks down upon the two seas which lie in the opposite directions. From Leucas to Patræ upon the Corinthian gulf is a distance of eighty-eight miles. The colony of Patræ<@11> is founded upon the most extensive promontory of the Peloponnesus, facing Ætolia and the river Evenus, the Corinthian Gulf being, as we have previously<@12> stated, less than a mile in width at the entrance there, though extending in length as far as the isthmus, a distance of eighty-five miles."

The mountains of Phthiotis are Nymphæus, once so beautiful for its garden scenery, the work of nature; Busygæus, Donacesa, Bermius<@12>, Daphusa, Chimerion, Athamas, and Stephane. In Thessaly there are thirty-four, of which the most famous are Cercetii, Olympus<@13>, Pierus, and Ossa, opposite to which last are Pindus and Othrys, the abodes of the Lapithæ. These mountains look towards the west, Pelion<@14> towards the east, all of them forming a curve like an amphitheatre, in the interior of which, lying before them, are no less than seventy-five cities. The rivers of Thessaly are the Apidanus<@15>, the Phœnix<@16>, the Enipeus<@17>, the Onochonus<@18>, and the Pamisus. There is also the Fountain of Messeis, and the lake Bœbeis<@19>. The river Peneus<@20> too, superior to all others in celebrity, takes its rise near Gomphi, and flows down a well-wooded valley between Ossa and Olympus, a distance of five hundred stadia, being navigable half that distance. The vale, for a distance of five miles through which this river runs, is called by the name of Tempe; being a jugerum<@21> and a half nearly in breadth, while on the right and left, the mountain chain slopes away with a gentle elevation, beyond the range of human vision, the foliage imparting its colour to the light within. Along this vale glides the Peneus, reflecting the green tints as it rolls along its pebbly bed, its banks covered with tufts of verdant herbage, and enlivened by the melodious warblings of the birds. The Peneus receives the river Orcus, or rather, I should say, does not receive it, but merely carries its waters, which swim on its surface like oil, as Homer says<@22>; and then, after a short time, rejects them, refusing to allow the waters of a river devoted to penal sufferings and engendered for the Furies to mingle with his silvery streams."

      "Macedonia comes next, including 150 nations, and renowned for its two kings<@1> and its former empire over the world; it was formerly known by the name of Emathia<@2>. Stretching away towards the nations of Epirus on the west it lies at the back of Magnesia and Thessaly, being itself exposed to the attacks of the Dardani<@3>. Pæonia and Pelagonia protect its northern parts from the Triballi<@4>. Its towns are Ægiæ<@5>, at which place its kings were usually buried, Beræa<@6>, and, in the country called Pieria from the grove of that name, Æginium<@7>. Upon the coast are Heraclea<@8>, the river Apilas<@9>, the towns of Pydna<@10> and Aloros<@11>, and the river Haliacmon<@12>. In the interior are the Aloritæ<@13>, the Vallæi<@14>, the Ph1lylacæi, the Cyrrhestæ<@15>, the Tyrissæi, the colony of Pella<@16>, and Stobi<@17>, a town with the rights of Roman citizens. Next comes Antigonea<@18>, Europus<@19> upon the river Axius, and another place of the same name by which the Rhœmdias flows, Scydra, Eordæa, Mieza, and Gordyniæ. Then, upon the coast, Ichne<@20>, and the river Axius: along this frontier the Dardani, the Treres<@21>, and the Pieres, border on Macedonia. Leaving this river, there are the nations of Pæonia<@22>, the Paroræi<@23>, the Eordenses<@24>, the Almopii<@25>, the Pelagones, and the Mygdones<@26>.",
      "Next come the mountains of Rhodope, Scopius, and Orbelus; and, lying along the extent of country in front of these mountains, the Arethusii<@27>, the Antiochienses<@28>, the Idomenenses<@29>, the Doberi<@30>, the Æstræenses, the Allantenses, the Audaristenses, the Morylli, the Garesci<@31>, the Lyncestæ<@32>, the Othryonei<@33>, and the Amantini<@34> and Orestæ<@35>, both of them free peoples; the colonies of Bullis<@36> and Dium<@37>, the Xylopolitæ, the Scotussæi, a free people, Heraclea Sintica<@38>, the Tymphæi<@39>, and the Toronæi.",
      "Upon the coast of the Macedonian Gulf there are the town of Chalastra<@40>, and, more inland, Piloros; also Lete, and at the extreme bend of the Gulf, Thessalonica<@41>, a free city; (from this place to Dyrrhachium it is 245 miles<@42>,) and then Thermæ<@43>. Upon the Gulf<@44> of Thermæ are the towns of Dicæa, Pydna<@45>, Derra, Scione<@46>, the Promontory of Canastræum<@47>, and the towns of Pallene<@48> and Phlegra. In this region also are the mountains Hypsizorus, Epitus, Halcyone, and Leoomne; the towns of Nyssos<@49>, Phryxelon, Mendæ, and what was formerly Potidæa<@50> on the isthmus of Pallene, but now the Colony of Cassandria; Anthemus<@51>, Olophyxus<@52>, and the Gulf of Mecyberna<@53>; the towns of Miscella, Ampelos<@54>, Torone<@55>, Singos<@56>, and the canal, a mile and a half in length, by means of which Xerxes, king of the Persians, cut off Mount Athos<@57> from the main land. This mountain projects from the level plain of the adjacent country into the sea, a distance of seventy-five<@58> miles; its circumference at its base being 150 miles in extent. There was formerly upon its summit the town of Acroathon<@59>: the present towns are Uranopolis<@60>, Palæorium, Thyssus, Cleonæ<@61>, and Apollonia, the inhabitants of which have the surname of Macrobii<@62>. The town also of Cassera, and then the other side of the Isthmus, after which come Acanthus<@63>, Stagira<@64>, Sithone<@65>, Heraclea<@66>, and the country of Mygdonia that lies below, in which are situate, at some distance from the sea, Apollonia<@67> and Arethusa. Again, upon the coast we have Posidium<@68>, and the bay with the town of Cermorus, Amphipolis<@69>, a free town, and the nation of the Bisaltæ. We then come to the river Strymon<@70> which takes its rise in Mount Hæmus<@71> and forms the boundary of Macedonia: it is worthy of remark that it first discharges itself into seven lakes before it proceeds onward in its course.",
      "Such is Macedonia, which was once the mistress of the world, which once extended<@72> her career over Asia, Armenia, Iberia, Albania, Cappadocia, Syria, Egypt, Taurus, and Caucasus, which reduced the whole of the East under her power, and triumphed over the Bactri, the Medes, and the Persians. She too it was who proved the conqueror of India, thus treading in the footsteps of Father Liber<@73> and of Hercules; and this is that same Macedonia, of which our own general Paulus Æmilius sold to pillage seventy-two<@74> cities in one day. So great the difference in her lot resulting from the actions of two<@75> individuals!"

      "Thrace now follows, divided into fifty strategies<@1>, and to be reckoned among the most powerful nations of Europe. Among its peoples whom we ought not to omit to name are the Denseletæ and the Medi, dwelling upon the right bank of the Strymon, and joining up to the Bisaltæ above<@2> mentioned; on the left there are the Digerri and a number of tribes of the Bessi<@3>, with various names, as far as the river Mestus<@4>, which winds around the foot of Mount Pan- gæum<@5>, passing among the Elethi, the Diobessi<@6>, the Carbilesi; and then the Brysæ, the Sapæi, and the Odomanti. The territory of the Odrysæ<@7> gives birth to the Hebrus<@8>, its banks being inhabited by the Cabyleti, the Pyrogeri, the Drugeri, the Cænici, the Hypsalti, the Beni, the Corpili, the Bottiæi, and the Edoni<@9>. In the same district are also the Selletæ, the Priantæ, the Doloncæ, the Thyni, and the Greater Cœletæ, below Mount Hæmus, the Lesser at the foot of Rhodope. Between these tribes runs the river Hebrus. We then come to a town at the foot of Rhodope, first called Poneropolis<@10>, afterwards Philippopolis<@11> from the name of its founder, and now, from the peculiarity of its situation, Trimontium<@12>. To reach the summit of Hæmus you have to travel six<@13> miles. The sides of it that look in the opposite direction and slope towards the Ister are inhabited by the Mœsi<@14>, the Getæ, the Aorsi, the Gaudæ, and the Clariæ; below them, are the Arræi Sarmatæ<@15>, also called Arreatæ, the Scythians, and, about the shores of the Euxine, the Moriseni and the Sithonii, the forefathers of the poet Orpheus<@16>, dwell.",
      "Thus is Thrace bounded by the Ister on the north, by the Euxine, and the Propontis<@17> on the east, and by the Ægean Sea on the south; on the coast of which, after leaving the Strymon, we come in turn to Apollonia<@18>, Œsyma<@19>, Neapolis<@20> and Datos. In the interior is the colony of Philippi<@21>, distant from Dyrrhachium 325 miles; also Scotussa<@22>, the city of Topiris, the mouth of the river Mestus<@23>, Mount Pangæus, Heraclea<@24>, Olynthos<@25>, Abdera<@26>, a free city, the people of the Bistones<@27> and their Lake. Here was formerly the city of Tirida, which struck such terror with its stables of the horses<@28> of Diomedes. At the present day we find here Dicæa<@29>, Ismaron<@30>, the place where Parthenion stood, Phalesina, and Maronea<@31>, formerly called Orthagorea. We then come to Mount Serrium<@32> and Zone<@33>, and then the place called Doriscus<@34>, capable of containing ten thousand men, for it was in bodies of ten thousand that Xerxes here numbered his army. We then come to the mouth of the Hebrus<@35>, the Port of Stentor, and the free town of Ænos<@36>, with the tomb there of Polydorus<@37>, the region formerly of the Cicones.",
      "From Doriscus there is a winding coast as far as Macron Tichos<@38>, or the \"Long Wall,\" a distance of 122 miles; round Doriscus flows the river Melas, from which the Gulf of Melas<@39> receives its name. The towns are, Cypsela<@40>, Bisanthe<@41>, and Macron Tichos, already mentioned, so called because a wall extends from that spot between the two seas,—that is to say, from the Propontis to the Gulf of Melas, thus excluding the Chersonesus<@42>, which projects beyond it.",
      "The other side of Thrace now begins, on the coast<@43> of the Euxine, where the river Ister discharges itself; and it is in this quarter perhaps that Thrace possesses the finest cities, Histropolis<@44>, namely, founded by the Milesians, Tomi<@45>, and Callatis<@46>, formerly called Acervetis. It also had the cities of Heraclea and Bizone, which latter was swallowed up by an earthquake; it now has Dionysopolis<@47>, formerly called Cruni, which is washed by the river Zyras. All this country was formerly possessed by the Scythians, surnamed Aroteres; their towns were, Aphrodisias, Libistos, Zygere, Rocobe, Eumenia, Parthenopolis, and Gerania<@48>, where a nation of Pigmies is said to have dwelt; the barbarians used to call them Cattuzi, and entertain a belief that they were put to flight by cranes. Upon the coast, proceeding from Dionysopolis, is Odessus<@49>, a city of the Milesians, the river Panysus<@50>, and the town of Tetranaulo- chus. Mount Hæmus, which, with its vast chain, overhangs the Euxine, had in former times upon its summit the town of Aristæum<@51>. At the present day there are upon the coast Mesembria<@52>, and Anchialum<@53>, where Messa formerly stood. The region of Astice formerly had a town called Anthium; at the present day Apollonia<@54> occupies its site. The rivers here are the Panisos, the Riras, the Tearus, and the Orosines; there are also the towns of Thynias<@55>, Halmydessos<@56>, Develton<@57>, with its lake, now known as Deultum, a colony of veterans, and Phinopolis, near which last is the Bosporus<@58>. From the mouth of the Ister to the entrance of the Euxine, some writers have made to be a distance of 555 miles; Agrippa, however, increases the length by sixty miles. The distance thence to Macron Tichos, or the Long Wall, previously mentioned, is 150 miles; and, from it to the extremity of the Chersonesus, 125.",
      "On leaving the Bosporus we come to the Gulf of Casthenes<@59>, and two harbours, the one called the Old Men's Haven, and the other the Women's Haven. Next comes the promontory of Chrysoceras<@60>, upon which is the town of Byzantium<@61>, a free state, formerly called Lygos, distant from Dyrrhachium 711 miles,—so great being the space of land that intervenes between the Adriatic Sea and the Propontis. We next come to the rivers Bathynias and Pydaras<@62>, or Athyras, and the towns of Selymbria<@63> and Perinthus<@64>, which join the mainland by a neck only 200 feet in width. In the interior are Bizya<@65>, a citadel of the kings of Thrace, and hated by the swallows, in consequence of the sacrilegious crime of Tereus<@66>; the district called Cænica<@67>, and the colony of Flaviopolis, where formerly stood a town called Cæla. Then, at a distance of fifty miles from Bizya, we come to the colony of Apros, distant from Philippi 180 miles. Upon the coast is the river Erginus<@68>; here formerly stood the town of Ganos<@69>; and Lysimachia<@70> in the Chersonesus is being now gradually deserted.",
      "At this spot there is another isthmus<@71>, similar in name to the other<@72>, and of about equal width; and, in a manner by no means dissimilar, two cities formerly stood on the shore, one on either side, Pactye on the side of the Propontis, and Cardia<@73> on that of the Gulf of Melas, the latter deriving its name from the shape<@74> which the land assumes. These, however, were afterwards united with Lysimachia<@75>, which stands at a distance of five miles from Macron Tichos. The Chersonesus formerly had, on the side of the Propontis, the towns of Tiristasis, Crithotes, and Cissa<@76>, on the banks of the river Ægos<@77>; it now has, at a distance of twenty-two<@78> miles from the colony of Apros, Resistos, which stands opposite to the colony of Parium. The Hellespont also, which separates, as we have already<@79> stated, Europe from Asia, by a channel seven stadia in width, has four cities facing each other, Callipolis<@80> and Sestos<@81> in Europe, and Lampsacus<@82> and Abydos<@83> in Asia. On the Chersonesus, there is the promontory of Mastusia<@84>, lying opposite to Sigeum<@85>; upon one side of it stands the Cynossema<@86> (for so the tomb of Hecuba is called), the naval station<@87> of the Achæans, and a tower; and near it the shrine<@88> of Protesilaüs. On the ex- treme front of the Chersonesus, which is called Æolium, there is the city of Elæs. Advancing thence towards the Gulf of Melas, we have the port of Cœlos<@89>, Panormus, and then Cardia, previously mentioned.",
      "In this manner is the third great Gulf of Europe bounded. The mountains of Thrace, besides those already mentioned, are Edonus, Gigemoros, Meritus, and Melamphyllos; the rivers are the Bargus and the Syrmus, which fall into the Hebrus. The length of Macedonia, Thrace, and the Hellespont has been already<@90> mentioned; some writers, however, make it 720 miles, the breadth being 384.",
      "What may be called a rock rather than an island, lying between Tenos and Chios, has given its name to the Ægean Sea; it has the name of Æx<@91> from its strong resemblance to a goat, which is so called in Greek, and shoots precipitately from out of the middle of the sea. Those who are sailing towards the isle of Andros from Achaia, see this rock on the left, boding no good, and warning them of its dangers. Part of the Ægean Sea bears the name of Myrtoan<@92>, being so called from the small island [of Myrtos] which is seen as you sail towards Macedonia from Geræstus, not far from Carystus<@93> in Eubœa. The Romans include all these seas under two names,—the Macedonian, in those parts where it touches the coasts of Macedonia or Thrace, and the Grecian where it washes the shores of Greece The Greeks, however, divide the Ionian Sea into the Sicilian and the Cretan Seas, after the name of those islands; and they give the name of Icarian to that part which lies between Samos and Myconos. The gulfs which we have already mentioned, have given to these seas the rest of their names. Such, then, are the seas and the various nations which are comprehended in the third great Gulf of Europe."

    "paragraphs": [
      "Lying opposite to Thesprotia, at a distance of twelve miles from Buthrotus, and of fifty from Acroceraunia, is the island of Corcyra<@1>, with a city of the same name, the citizens of which are free; also a town called Cassiope<@2>, and a temple dedicated to Jupiter Cassius. This island is ninety-seven miles in length, and in Homer has the names of Scheria and Phæacia; while Callimachus calls it Drepane. There are some other islands around it, such as Thoronos<@3>, lying in the direction of Italy, and the two islands of Paxos<@4> in that of Leucadia, both of them five miles distant from Corcyra. Not far<@5> from these, and in front of Corcyra, are Ericusa, Marathe, Elaphusa, Malthace, Trachie, Pythionia, Ptychia, Tarachie, and, off Phalacrum<@6>, a promontory of Corcyra, the rock into which (according to the story, which arises no doubt from the similarity of appearance) the ship of Ulysses was changed.",
      "Before Leucimna<@7> we find the islands of Sybota, and between Leucadia and Achaia a great number of islands, among which are those called Teleboïdes<@8>, as also Taphiæ; by the natives, those which lie before Leucadia are called by the names of Taphias, Oxiæ, and Prinoessa<@9>; while those that are in front of Ætolia are the Echinades<@10>, consisting of Ægialia, Cotonis, Thyatira, Geoaris, Dionysia, Cyrnus, Chalcis, Pinara, and Mystus.",
      "In front of these, and lying out at sea, are Cephallenia<@11> and Zacynthus<@12>, both of them free, Ithaca<@13>, Dulichium<@14>, Same<@15>, and Crocyle<@16>. Cephallenia, formerly known as Melæna<@17>, lies at a distance of eleven miles from Paxos, and is ninety-three miles in circumference: its city of Same has been levelled to the ground by the Romans; but it still possesses three others<@18>. Between this island and Achaia lies the island of Zacynthus, remarkable for its city of the same name, and for its singular fertility. It formerly had the name of Hyrie, and lies to the south of Cephallenia, at a distance of twenty-five miles; in it there is the famous mountain of Elatus<@19>. This island is thirty-six miles in circumference. At a distance of fifteen miles from Zacynthus is Ithaca, in which is Mount Neritus<@20>; its circumference in all is twenty-five miles. Twelve miles distant from this island is Araxus<@21>, a promontory of the Peloponnesus. Before Ithaca, lying out in the main sea, are Asteris<@22> and Prote; and before Zacynthus, at a distance of thirty-five miles in the direction of the south-east wind, are the two Strophades<@23>, by some known as the Plotæ. Before Cephallenia lies Letoia<@24>, before Pylos the three Sphagiæ<@25>, and before Messene the Œnussæ<@26>, as many in number.",
      "In the Asinæan Gulf there are the three Thyrides<@27>, and in that of Laconia Theganusa<@28>, Cothon, and Cythera<@29>, with the town of that name, the former name of which island was Porphyris. It is situate five miles from the promontory of Malea<@30>, thus forming a strait very dangerous to navigation. In the Gulf of Argolis are Pityusa<@31>, Irine, and Ephyre; opposite the territory of Hermione<@32>, Tiparenus, Aperopia<@33>, Colonis<@34>, and Aristera; and, opposite that of Trœzen, Calauria<@35>, at a distance of half a mile, Plateis<@36>, Belbina, Lasia, and Baucidias. Opposite Epidaurus is Cecryphalos<@37>, and Pityonesos<@38>, six miles distant from the mainland; and, at a distance of fifteen miles from this last, Ægina<@39>, a free island, the length of which, as you sail past it, is eighteen miles. This island is twenty miles distant from Piræus, the port of Athens: it used formerly to be called Œnone. Opposite the promontory of Spiræum<@40>, lie Eleusa<@41>, Adendros<@42>, the two islands called Craugiæ, the two Cæciæ, Selachusa Cenehreis, and Aspis; as also, in the Gulf of Megara, the four Methurides. Ægila<@43> lies at a distance of fifteen miles from Cythera, and of twenty-five from Phalasarna, a city of Crete."

      "Crete itself lies from east to west, the one side facing the south, the other the north, and is known to fame by the renown of its hundred cities. Dosiades says, that it took its name from the nymph Crete, the daughter of Hesperides<@1>; Anaximander, from a king of the Curetes, Philistides of Mallus * * * * *; while Crates says that it was at first called Aëria, and after that Curetis; and some have been of opinion that it had the name of Macaron<@2> from the serenity of its climate. In breadth it nowhere exceeds fifty miles, being widest about the middle. In length, however, it is full 270 miles, and 589 in circumference, forming a bend towards the Cretan Sea, which takes its name from it. At its eastern extremity is the Promontory of Sammonium<@3>, facing Rhodes, while towards the west it throws out that of Criumetopon<@4>, in the direction of Cyrene.",
      "The more remarkable cities of Crete are, Phalasarna, Etæa<@5>, Cisamon<@6>, Pergamum, Cydonia<@7>, Minoium<@8>, Apteron<@9>, Pantomatrium, Amphimalla<@10>, Rhithymna, Panormus, Cytæum, Apollonia, Matium<@11>, Heraclea, Miletos, Ampelos, Hierapytna<@12>, Lebena<@13>, and Hierapolis; and, in the interior, Gortyna<@14>, Phæstum, Cnossus<@15>, Polyrrenium, Myrina, Lycastus, Rhamnus, Lyctus, Dium<@16>, Asus, Pyloros, Rhytion, Elatos, Pharæ, Holopyxos, Lasos, Eleuthernæ<@17>, Therapnæ, Marathusa, and Tylisos; besides some sixty others, of which the memory only exists. The mountains are those of Cadistus<@18>, Ida, Dictynnæus, and Corycus<@19>. This island is distant, at its promontory of Criumetopon, according to Agrippa, from Phycus<@20>, the promontory of Cyrene, 125 miles; and at Cadistus, from Malea in the Peloponnesus, eighty. From the island of Carpathos<@21>, at its promontory of Sammonium it lies in a westerly direction, at a distance of sixty miles; this last-named island is situate between it and Rhodes.",
      "The other islands in its vicinity, and lying in front of the Peloponnesus, are the two isles known as Corycæ, and the two called Mylæ<@22>. On the north side, having Crete on the right, and opposite to Cydonia, is Leuce<@23>, and the two islands known as Budroæ<@24>. Opposite to Matium lies Dia<@25>; opposite to the promontory of Itanum<@26>, Onisia and Leuce; and over against Hierapytna, Chrysa and Gaudos<@27>. In the same neighbourhood, also, are Ophiussa, Butoa, and Aradus; and, after doubling Criumetopon, we come to the three islands known as Musagorus. Before the promontory of Sammonium lie the islands of Phocœ, the Platiæ, the Sirnides, Naulochos, Armedon, and Zephyre.",
      "Belonging to Hellas, but still in the Ægean Sea, we have the Lichades<@28>, consisting of Scarphia, Coresa, Phocaria, and many others which face Attica, but have no towns upon them, and are consequently of little note. Opposite Eleusis, however, is the far-famed Salamis<@29>; before it, Psyttalia<@30>; and, at a distance of five miles from Sunium, the island of Helene<@31>. At the same distance from this last is Ceos<@32>, which some of our countrymen have called Cea, and the Greeks Hydrussa, an island which has been torn away from Eubœa. It was formerly 500 stadia in length; but more recently four-fifths of it, in the direction of Bœotia, have been swallowed up by the sea. The only towns it now has left are Iulis and Carthæa<@33>; Coresus<@34> and Pœëessa<@35> have perished. Varro informs us, that from this place there used to come a cloth of very fine texture, used for women's dresses."

At the south, this island is remarkable for its two promontories, that of Geræstus<@3>, which looks towards Attica, and that of Caphareus<@4>, which faces the Hellespont; on the north it has that of Cenæum<@5>. In no part does this island extend to a greater breadth than forty miles, while it never contracts to less than two. In length it runs along the whole coast of Bœotia, extending from Attica as far as Thessaly, a distance of 150 miles<@6>. In circumference it measures 365, and is distant from the Hellespont, on the side of Caphareus, 225 miles. The cities for which it was formerly famous were, Pyrrha, Porthmos, Nesos, Cerinthos<@7>, Oreum, Dium, Ædepsos<@8>, Ocha, and Œchalia; at present it is ennobled by those of Chalcis<@9> (opposite which, on the mainland, is Aulis), Geræstus<@10>, Eretria<@11>, Carystus<@12>, Oritanum, and Artemisium<@13>.

Off the promontory, too, of Geræstus are the Cyclades, lying in a circle around Delos, from which circumstance<@3> they derive their name. The first of them is the one called Andros<@4> with a city of the same name, distant from Geræstus ten miles, and from Ceos thirty-nine. Myrsilus tells us that this island was at first called Cauros, and after that Antandros; Callimachus calls it Lasia, and others again Nonagria, Hydrussa, and Epagris. It is ninety-three miles in circumference. At a distance of one mile from Andros and of fifteen from Delos, is Tenos<@5>, with a city of the same name; this island is fifteen miles in length. Aristotle says that it was formerly called Hydrussa, from the abundance of water found here, while some writers call it Ophiussa<@6>. The other islands are, Myconos<@7>, with the mountain of Dimastus<@8>, distant from Delos fifteen<@9> miles; Siphnus<@10>, formerly called Meropia and Acis, twenty-eight miles in circumference; Seriphus<@11>, twelve miles in circuit; Prepesinthus<@12>; Cythnos<@13>; and then, by far the most famous among the Cyclades, and lying in the very middle of them, Delos<@14> itself; so famous for its temple of Apollo, and its extensive commerce. This island long floated on the waves, and, as tradition says, was the only one that had never experienced an earthquake, down to the time of M. Varro<@15>; Mucianus however has informed us, that it has been twice so visited. Aristotle states that this island received its name from the fact of its having so suddenly made its appearance<@16> on emerging from the sea; Aglaosthenes, however, gives it the name of Cynthia, and others of Ortygia<@17>, Asteria, Lagia, Chlamydia, Cynthus, and, from the circumstance of fire having been first discovered here, Pyrpile. Its circumference is five miles only; Mount Cynthus<@18> here raises his head.",
      "Next to this island is Rhene<@19>, which Anticlides calls by the name of Celadussa, and Callidemus, Artemite; Scyros<@20>, which the old writers have stated to be twenty miles in circumference, but Mucianus 160; Oliaros<@21>; and Paros<@22>, with a city of the same name, distant from Delos thirty-eight miles, and famous for its marble<@23>; it was first called Platea, and after that, Minois. At a distance of seven miles from this last island is Naxos<@24>, with a town of the same name; it is eighteen miles distant from Delos. This island was formerly called Strongyle<@25>, then Dia, and then Dionysias<@26>, in consequence of the fruitfulness of its vineyards; others again have called it the Lesser Sicily, or Callipolis<@27>.

It is situate fifty miles to the north-east of Delos, and thirty-five from the island of Samos. Between Eubœa and Andros, there is an arm of the sea ten miles in width, and from Icaros to Geræstus is a distance of 112 1/2 miles.",

There is the island of Scyros<@6>, and that of los<@7>, eighteen miles distant from Naxos, and deserving of all veneration for the tomb there of Homer; it is twenty-five miles in length, and was formerly known by the name of Phœnice; also Odia, Oletandros, and Gyara<@8>, with a city of the same name, the island being twelve miles in circumference, and distant from Andros sixty-two. At a distance of eighty miles from Gyara is Syrnos, then Cynæthus, Telos<@9>, noted for its unguents, and by Callimachus called Agathussa, Donusa<@10>, Patmos<@11>, thirty miles in circumference, the Corassiæ<@12>, Le- binthus<@13>, Leros<@14>, Cinara<@15>; Sicinus<@16>, formerly called Œnoe<@17>; Hieracia, also called Onus; Casos<@18>, likewise called Astrabe; Cimolus<@19>, or Echinussa; and Melos<@20>, with a city of that name, which island Aristides calls Memblis, Aristotle Zephyria, Callimachus Mimallis, Heraclides Siphis and Acytos.

Athos has before it four islands; Peparethus<@42>, formerly called Evœnus, with a city of that name, at a distance from Athos of nine miles; Sciathus<@43>, at a distance of fifteen, and Imbros<@44>, with a city of the same name, at a distance of eighty-eight, miles.

At a distance of twenty-two miles from it is Lemnos<@46>, being distant from Mount Athos eighty- seven; it is 112 miles in circumference, and has the cities of Hephæstia and Myrina<@47>; into the market-place of which last city Athos throws its shadow at the summer solstice. The island of Thasos<@48>, constituting a free state, is six miles distant from Lemnos; it formerly had the name of Aëria, or Æthria. Abdera<@49>, on the mainland, is distant from Thasos twenty-two miles, Athos sixty-two<@50>. The island of Samothrace<@51>, a free state, facing the river Hebrus, is the same distance from Thasos, being also thirty-two<@52> miles from Imbros, twenty-two from Lemnos, and thirty-eight<@53> from the coast of Thrace; it is thirty-two miles in circumference, and in it rises Mount Saoce<@54>, ten miles in height.

    "paragraphs": [
      "The fourth great Gulf of Europe begins at the Hellespont and ends at the entrance of the Mæotis<@1>. But in order that the several portions of the Euxine and its coasts may be the better known, we must briefly embrace the form of it in one general view. This vast sea, lying in front of Asia, is shut out from Europe by the projection of the shores of the Chersonesus, and effects an entrance into those countries by a narrow channel only, of the width, as already mentioned, of seven stadia, thus separating Europe from Asia. The entrance of these Straits is called the Hellespont; over it Xerxes, the king of the Persians, constructed a bridge of boats, across which he led his army. A narrow channel extends thence a distance of eighty-six miles, as far as Priapus<@2>, a city of Asia, at which Alexander the Great passed over. At this point the sea becomes wider, and after some distance again takes the form of a narrow strait. The wider part is known as the Propontis<@3>, the Straits as the Thracian Bosporus<@4>, being only half-a- mile in width, at the place where Darius, the father of Xerxes, led his troops across by a bridge. The extremity of this is distant from the Hellespont 239 miles.",
      "We then come to the vast sea called the Euxine, which invades the land as it retreats afar, and the name of which was formerly Axenus<@5>. As the shores bend inwards, this sea with a vast sweep stretches far away, curving on both sides after the manner of a pair of horns, so much so that in shape it bears a distinct resemblance to a Scythian bow<@6>. In the middle of the curve it is joined by the mouth of Lake Mæotis, which is called the Cimmerian<@7> Bosporus, and is two miles and a half in width. Between the two Bospori, the Thracian and the Cimmerian, there is a distance in a straight line, of 500 miles, as Polybius informs us. We learn from Varro and most of the ancient writers, that the circumference of the Euxine is altogether 2150 miles; but to this number Cornelius Nepos adds 350 more; while Artemidorus makes it 2919 miles, Agrippa 2360, and Mucianus 2425. In a similar manner some writers have fixed the length of the European shores of this sea at 1478 miles, others again at 1172. M. Varro gives the measurement as follows:—from the mouth of the Euxine to Apollonia 187 miles, and to Callatis the same distance; thence to the mouth of the Ister 125 miles; to the Borysthenes 250; to Chersonesus<@8>, a town of the Heracleotæ, 325; to Panticapæum<@9>, by some called Bosporus, at the very extremity of the shores of Europe, 212 miles: the whole of which added together, makes 1337<@10> miles. Agrippa makes the distance from Byzantium to the river Ister 560 miles, and from thence to Panticapæum, 635.",
      "Lake Mæotis, which receives the river Tanais as it flows from the Riphæan Mountains<@11>, and forms the extreme boundary between Europe and Asia, is said to be 1406 miles in circumference; which however some writers state at only 1125. From the entrance of this lake to the mouth of the Tanais in a straight line is, it is generally agreed, a distance of 375 miles.",
      "The inhabitants of the coasts of this fourth great Gulf of Europe, as far as Istropolis, have been already<@12> mentioned in our account of Thrace. Passing beyond that spot we come to the mouths of the Ister. This river rises in Germany in the heights of Mount Abnoba<@13>, opposite to Rauricum<@14>, a town of Gaul, and flows for a course of many miles beyond the Alps and through nations innumerable, under the name of the Danube. Adding immensely to the volume of its waters, at the spot where it first enters Illyricum, it assumes the name of Ister, and, after receiving sixty rivers, nearly one half of which are navigable, rolls into the Euxine by six<@15> vast channels. The first of these is the mouth of Peuce<@16>, close to which is the island of Peuce itself, from which the neighbouring channel takes its name; this mouth is swallowed up in a great swamp nineteen miles in length. From the same channel too, above Istropolis, a lake<@17> takes its rise, sixty-three miles in circuit; its name is Halmyris. The second mouth is called Naracu-Stoma<@18>; the third, which is near the island of Sarmatica, is called Calon-Stoma<@19>; the fourth is known as Pseudo-Stomon<@20>, with its island called Conopon-Diabasis<@21>; after which come the Boreon- Stoma<@22> and the Psilon-Stoma<@23>. These mouths are each of them so considerable, that for a distance of forty miles, it is said, the saltness of the sea is quite overpowered, and the water found to be fresh."

The higher<@5> parts again, between the Danube and the Hercynian Forest<@6>, as far as the winter quarters of Pannonia at Carnuntum<@7>, and the borders of the Germans, are occupied by the Sarmatian lazyges<@8>, who inhabit the level country and the plains, while the Daci, whom they have driven as far as the river Pathissus<@9>, inhabit the mountain and forest ranges.

The Tyragetæ inhabit a large island<@3> situate in this river, which is distant from Pseudostomos, a mouth of the Ister, so called, 130 miles.

This Buges is separated by a ridge of rocks<@26> from Coretus, a gulf in the Lake Mæotis; it receives the rivers Buges<@27>, Gerrus<@28>, and Hypacaris<@29>, which approach it from regions that lie in various directions. For the Gerrus separates the Basilidæ from the Nomades, the Hypacaris flows through the Nomades and the Hylæi, by an artificial channel into Lake Buges, and by its natural one into the Gulf of Coretus: this region bears the name of Scythia Sindice.",
      "At the river Carcinites, Scythia Taurica<@30> begins, which was once covered by the sea, where we now see level plains extended on every side: beyond this the land rises into mountains of great elevation. The peoples here are thirty in number, of which twenty-three dwell in the interior, six of the cities being inhabited by the Orgocyni, the Chara- ceni<@31>, the Lagyrani, the Tractari, the Arsilachitæ, and the Caliordi. The Scythotauri possess the range of mountains: on the west they are bounded by the Chersonesus, and on the east by the Scythian Satarchæ<@32>. On the shore, after we leave Carcinites, we find the following towns; Taphræ<@33>, situate on the very isthmus of the peninsula, and then Heraclea Chersonesus<@34>, to which its freedom has been granted<@35> by the Romans. This place was formerly called Megarice, being the most polished city throughout all these regions, in consequence of its strict preservation of Grecian manners and customs. A wall, five miles in length, surrounds it. Next to this comes the Promontory of Parthenium<@36>, the city of the Tauri, Placia, the port of the Symboli<@37>, and the Promontory of Criumetopon<@38>, opposite to Carambis<@39>, a promontory of Asia, which runs out in the middle of the Euxine, leaving an intervening space between them of 170 miles, which circumstance it is in especial that gives to this sea the form of a Scythian bow. After leaving this headland we come to a great number of harbours and lakes of the Tauri<@40>. The town of Theodosia<@41> is distant from Criumetopon 125 miles, and from Chersonesus 165. Beyond it there were, in former times, the towns of Cytæ, Zephyrium, Acræ, Nymphæum, and Dia. Panticapæum<@42>, a city of the Milesians, by far the strongest of them all, is still in existence; it lies at the entrance of the Bosporus, and is distant from Theodosia eighty-seven miles and a half, and from the town of Cimmerium, which lies on the other side of the Strait, as we have previously<@43> stated, two miles and a half. Such is the width here of the channel which separates Asia from Europe, and which too, from being generally quite frozen over, allows of a passage on foot. The width of the Cimmerian Bosporus<@44> is twelve miles and a half: it contains the towns of Hermisium<@45>, Myrmecium, and, in the interior<@46> of it, the island of Alopece. From the spot called Taphræ<@47>, at the extremity of the isthmus, to the mouth of the Bosporus, along the line of the Lake Mæotis, is a distance of 260 miles.",
      "Leaving Taphræ, and going along the mainland, we find in the interior the Auchetæ<@48>, in whose country the Hypanis has its rise, as also the Neurœ, in whose district the Borysthenes has its source, the Geloni<@49>, the Thyssagetæ, the Budini, the Basilidæ, and the Agathyrsi<@50> with their azure-coloured hair. Above them are the Nomades, and then a nation of Anthropophagi or cannibals. On leaving Lake Buges, above the Lake Mæotis we come to the Sauromatæ and the Essedones<@51>. Along the coast, as far as the river Tanais<@52>, are the Mæotæ, from whom the lake derives its name, and the last of all, in the rear of them, the Arimaspi. We then come to the Riphæan<@53> mountains, and the region known by the name of Pterophoros<@54>, because of the perpetual fall of snow there, the flakes of which resemble feathers; a part of the world which has been condemned by the decree of nature to lie immersed in thick darkness; suited for nothing but the generation of cold, and to be the asylum of the chilling blasts of the northern winds.",
      "Behind these mountains, and beyond the region of the northern winds, there dwells, if we choose to believe it, a happy race, known as the Hyperborei<@55>, a race that lives to an extreme old age, and which has been the subject of many marvellous stories<@56>. At this spot are supposed to be the hinges upon which the world revolves, and the extreme limits of the revolutions of the stars. Here we find light for six months together, given by the sun in one continuous day, who does not, however, as some ignorant persons have asserted, conceal himself from the vernal equinox<@57> to autumn. On the contrary, to these people there is but one rising of the sun for the year, and that at the summer solstice, and but one setting, at the winter solstice. This region, warmed by the rays of the sun, is of a most delightful temperature, and exempt from every noxious blast. The abodes of the natives are the woods and groves; the gods receive their worship singly and in groups, while all discord and every kind of sickness are things utterly unknown. Death comes upon them only when satiated with life; after a career of feasting, in an old age sated with every luxury, they leap from a certain rock there into the sea; and this they deem the most desirable mode of ending existence. Some writers have placed these people, not in Europe, but at the very verge of the shores of Asia, because we find there a people called the Attacori<@58>, who greatly resemble them and occupy a very similar locality. Other writers again have placed them midway between the two suns, at the spot where it sets to the Antipodes and rises to us; a thing however that cannot possibly be, in consequence of the vast tract of sea which there intervenes. Those writers who place them nowhere<@59> but under a day which lasts for six months, state that in the morning they sow, at mid-day they reap, at sunset they gather in the fruits of the trees, and during the night conceal themselves in caves. Nor are we at liberty to entertain any doubts as to the existence of this race; so many authors<@60> are there who assert that they were in the habit of sending their first-fruits to Delos to present them to Apollo, whom in especial they worship. Virgins used to carry them, who for many years were held in high veneration, and received the rites of hospitality from the nations that lay on the route; until at last, in consequence of repeated violations of good faith, the Hyperboreans came to the determination to deposit these offerings upon the frontiers of the people who adjoined them, and they in their turn were to convey them on to their neighbours, and so from one to the other, till they should have arrived at Delos. However, this custom, even, in time fell into disuse.",
      "The length of Sarmatia, Scythia, and Taurica, and of the whole of the region which extends from the river Borysthenes, is, according to Agrippa, 980 miles, and its breadth 717. I am of opinion, however, that in this part of the earth all estimates of measurement are exceedingly doubtful."

      "But now, in conformity with the plan which I originally proposed, the remaining portions of this gulf must be described. As for its seas, we have already made mention of them.",
      "(13.) The Hellespont has no islands belonging to Europe that are worthy of mention. In the Euxine there are, at a distance of a mile and a half from the European shore, and of fourteen from the mouth of the Strait, the two Cyanæan<@1> islands, by some called the Symplegades<@2>, and stated in fabulous story to have run the one against the other; the reason being the circumstance that they are separated by so short an interval, that while to those who enter the Euxine opposite to them they appear to be two distinct islands, but if viewed in a somewhat oblique direction they have the appearance of becoming gradually united into one. On this side of the Ister there is the single island<@3> of the Apolloniates, eighty miles from the Thracian Bosporus; it was from this place that M. Lucullus brought the Capitoline<@4> Apollo. Those islands which are to be found between the mouths of the Ister we have already mentioned<@5>. Before the Borysthenes is Achillea<@6> previously referred to, known also by the names of Leuce and Macaron<@7>. Researches which have been made at the present day place this island at a distance of 140 miles from the Borysthenes, of 120 from Tyra, and of fifty from the island of Peuce. It is about ten miles in circumference. The remaining islands in the Gulf of Carcinites are Cephalonnesos, Rhosphodusa, and Macra. Before we leave the Euxine, we must not omit to notice the opinion expressed by many writers that all the interior<@8> seas take their rise in this one as the principal source, and not at the Straits of Gades. The reason they give for this supposition is not an improbable one—the fact that the tide is always running out of the Euxine and that there is never any ebb.",
      "We must now leave the Euxine to describe the outer portions<@9> of Europe. After passing the Riphæan mountains we have now to follow the shores of the Northern Ocean on the left, until we arrive at Gades. In this direction a great number of islands<@10> are said to exist that have no name; among which there is one which lies opposite to Scythia, mentioned under the name of Raunonia<@11>, and said to be at a distance of the day's sail from the mainland; and upon which, according to Timæus, amber is thrown up by the waves in the spring season. As to the remaining parts of these shores, they are only known from reports of doubtful authority. With reference to the Septentrional<@12> or Northern Ocean; Hecatæus calls it, after we have passed the mouth of the river Parapanisus, where it washes the Scythian shores, the Amalchian sea, the word 'Amalchian' signifying in the language of these races, frozen. Philemon again says that it is called Morimarusa or the \"Dead Sea\" by the Cimbri, as far as the Promontory of Rubeas, beyond which it has the name of the Cronian<@13> Sea. Xenophon of Lampsacus tells us that at a distance of three days' sail from the shores of Scythia, there is an island of immense size called Baltia<@14>, which by Pytheas is called Basilia<@15>. Some islands<@16> called Oönæ are said to be here, the inhabitants of which live on the eggs of birds and oats; and others again upon which human beings are produced with the feet of horses, thence called Hippopodes. Some other islands are also mentioned as those of the Panotii, the people of which have ears of such extraordinary size as to cover the rest of the body, which is otherwise left naked.",
      "Leaving these however, we come to the nation of the Ingævones<@17>, the first in Germany; at which we begin to have some information upon which more implicit reliance can be placed. In their country is an immense mountain called Sevo<@18>, not less than those of the Riphæan range, and which forms an immense gulf along the shore as far as the Promontory of the Cimbri. This gulf, which has the name of the 'Codanian,' is filled with islands; the most famous among which is Scandinavia<@19>, of a magnitude as yet unascertained: the only portion of it at all known is inhabited by the nation of the Hilleviones, who dwell in 500 villages, and call it a second world: it is generally supposed that the island of Eningia<@20> is of not less magnitude. Some writers state that these regions, as far as the river Vistula, are inhabited by the Sarmati, the Venedi<@21>, the Sciri, and the Hirri<@22>, and that there is a gulf there known by the name of Cylipenus<@23>, at the mouth of which is the island of Latris, after which comes another gulf, that of Lagnus, which borders on the Cimbri. The Cimbrian Promontory, running out into the sea for a great distance, forms a peninsula which bears the name of Cartris<@24>. Passing this coast, there are three and twenty islands which have been made known by the Roman arms<@25>: the most famous of which is Burcana<@26>, called by our people Fabaria, from the resemblance borne<@27> by a fruit which grows there spontaneously. There are those also called Glæsaria<@28> by our soldiers, from their amber; but by the barbarians they are known as Austeravia and Actania."

They are united to the mainland by a kind of isthmus, and appear as islands only when it is inundated in stormy weather.",

      "9": "As the whole of Pliny's description of the northern shores of Europe is replete with difficulties and obscurities, we cannot do better than transcribe the learned remarks of M. Parisot, the Geographical Editor of Ajasson's Edition, in reference to this subject. He says, \"Before entering on the discussion of this portion of Pliny's geography, let us here observe, once for all, that we shall not remark as worthy of our notice all those ridiculous hypotheses which could only take their rise in ignorance, precipitation, or a love of the marvellous. We shall decline then to recognize the Doffrefelds in the mountains of Sevo, the North Cape in the Promontory of Rubeas, and the Sea of Greenland in the Cronian Sea. The absurdity of these suppositions is proved by—I. The impossibility of the ancients ever making their way to these distant coasts without the aid of large vessels, the compass, and others of those appliances, aided by which European skill finds the greatest difficulty in navigating those distant seas. II. The immense lacune which would be found to exist in the descriptions of these distant seas and shores: for not a word do we find about those numerous archipelagos which are found scattered throughout the North Sea, not a word about Iceland, nor about the numberless seas and fiords on the coast of Norway. III. The absence of all remarks upon the local phænomena of these spots. The North Cape belongs to the second polar climate, the longest day there being two months and a half. Is it likely that navigators would have omitted to mention this remarkable phænomenon, well known to the Romans by virtue of their astronomical theories, but one with which practically they had never made themselves acquainted?—The only geographers who here merit our notice are those who are of opinion that in some of the coasts or islands here mentioned Pliny describes the Scandinavian Peninsula, and in others the Coast of Finland. The first question then is, to what point Pliny first carries us? It is evident that from the Black Sea he transports himself on a sudden to the shores of the Baltic, thus passing over at a single leap a considerable space filled with nations and unknown deserts. The question then is, what line has he followed? Supposing our author had had before his eyes a modern map, the imaginary line which he would have drawn in making this transition would have been from Odessa to the Kurisch- Haff. In this direction the breadth across Europe is contracted to a space, between the two seas, not more than 268 leagues in length. A very simple mode of reasoning will conclusively prove that Pliny has deviated little if anything from this route. If he fails to state in precise terms upon what point of the shores of the Baltic he alights after leaving the Riphæan mountains, his enumeration of the rivers which discharge themselves into that sea, and with which he concludes his account of Germany, will supply us with the requisite information, at all events in great part. In following his description of the coast, we find mention made of the following rivers, the Guttalus, the Vistula, the Elbe, the Weser, the Ems, the Rhine, and the Meuse. The five last mentioned follow in their natural order, from east to west, as was to be expected in a description starting from the east of Europe for its western extremity and the shores of Cadiz. We have a right to conclude then that the Guttalus was to the east of the Vistula. As we shall now endeavour to show, this river was no other than the Alle, a tributary of the Pregel, which the Romans probably, in advancing from west to east, considered as the principal stream, from the circumstance that they met with it, before coming to the larger river. The Pregel after being increased by the waters of the Alle or Guttalus falls into the Frisch-Haff, about one degree further west than the Kurisch-Haff. It may however be here remarked, Why not find a river more to the east, the Niemen, for instance, or the Duna, to be represented by the Guttalus? The Niemen in especial would suit in every respect equally well, because it discharges itself into the Kurisch-Haff. This conjecture however is incapable of support, when we reflect that the ancients were undoubtedly acquainted with some points of the coast to the east of the mouth of the Guttalus, but which, according to the system followed by our author, would form part of the Continent of Asia. These points are, 1st. The Cape Lytarinis (mentioned by Pliny, B. vi. c. 4). 2ndly. The mouth of the river Carambucis (similarly mentioned by him), and 3rdly, a little to the east of Cape Lytarmis, the mouth of the Tanais. The name of Cape Lytarmis suggests to us Lithuania, and probably represents Domess-Ness in Courland; the Carambucis can be no other than the Niemen; while the Tanais, upon which so many authors, ancient and modern, have exhausted their conjectures, from confounding it with the Southern Tanais which falls into the Sea of Azof, is evidently the same as the Dwina or Western Duna. This is established incontrovertibly both by its geographical position (the mouth of the Dwina being only fifty leagues to the east of Domess-Ness) and the identity evidently of the names Dwina and Tanais. Long since, Leibnitz was the first to remark the presence of the radical T. n, or D. n, either with or without a vowel, in the names of the great rivers of Eastern Europe; Danapris or Dnieper, Danaster or Dniester, Danube (in German Donau, in Hungarian Duna), Tanais or Don, for example; all which rivers however discharge themselves into the Black Sea. There can be little doubt then of the identity of the Duna with the Tanais, it being the only body of water in these vast countries which bears a name resembling the initial Tan, or Tn, and at the same time belongs to the basin of the Baltic. We are aware, it is true, that the White Sea receives a river Dwina, which is commonly called the Northern Dwina, but there can be no real necessity to be at the trouble of combating the opinion that this river is identical with the Northern Tanais. As the result then of our investigations, it is at the eastern extremity of the Frisch-Haff and near the mouth of the Pregel, that we would place the point at which Pliny sets out. As for the Riphæan mountains, they have never existed anywhere but in the head of the geographers from whom our author drew his materials. From the mountains of Ural and Poias, which Pliny could not possibly have in view, seeing that they lie in a meridian as eastern as the Caspian Sea, the traveller has to proceed 600 leagues to the south-west without meeting with any chains of mountains or indeed considerable elevations.\"",
      "10": "It is pretty clear that he refers to the numerous islands scattered over the face of the Baltic Sea, such as Dago, Oesel, Gothland, and Aland.",
      "11": "The old reading here was Bannomanna, which Dupinet would translate by the modern Bornholm. Parisot considers that the modern Runa, a calcareous rock covered with vegetable earth, in the vicinity of Domess- Ness, is the place indicated.",
      "12": "It has been suggested by Brotier that Pliny here refers to the Icy Sea, but it is more probable that he refers to the north-eastern part of the Baltic, which was looked upon by the ancients as forming part of the open sea.",
      "13": "With reference to these divisions of land and sea, a subject which is involved in the greatest obscurity, Parisot states it as his opinion that the Amalchian or Icy Sea is that portion of the Baltic which extends from Cape Rutt to Cape Grinea, while on the other hand the Cronian Sea comprehends all the gulfs which lie to the east of Cape Rutt, such as the Haff, the gulfs of Stettin and Danzic, the Frisch-Haff, and the Kurisch-Haff. He also thinks that the name of 'Cronian' originally belonged only to that portion of the Baltic which washes the coast of Courland, but that travellers gradually applied the term to the whole of the sea. He is also of opinion that the word \"Cronium\" owes its origin to the Teutonic and Danish adjective groen or \"green.\" The extreme verdure which characterizes the islands of the Danish archipelago has given to the piece of water which separates the islands of Falster and Moen the name of Groensund, and it is far from improbable that the same epithet was given to the Pomeranian and Prussian Seas, which the Romans would be not unlikely to call 'Gronium' or 'Cronium fretum,' or 'Cronium mare.' In the name 'Parapanisus' he also discovers a resemblance to that of modern Pomerania.",
      "14": "Upon this Parisot remarks that on leaving Cape Rutt, at a distance of about twenty-five leagues in a straight line, we come to the island of Funen or Fyen, commonly called Fionia, the most considerable of the Danish archipelago next to Zealand, and which lying between the two Belts, the Greater and the Smaller, may very probably from that circumstance have obtained the name of Baltia. Brotier takes Baltia to be no other than Nova Zembla—so conflicting are the opinions of commentators!",
      "15": "Parisot suggests that under this name may possibly lie concealed that of the modern island of Zealand or Seeland, and that it may have borne on the side of it next to the Belt the name of Baltseeland, easily corrupted by the Greeks into Basilia.",
      "16": "Brotier takes these to be the islands of Aloo, and Bieloi or Ostrow, at the mouth of the river Paropanisus, which he considers to be the same as the Obi. Parisot on the other hand is of opinion that islands of the Baltic are here referred to; that from the resemblance of the name Oönæ to the Greek ὠὸν, \"an egg,\" the story that the natives subsisted on the eggs of birds was formed; that not improbably the group of the Hippopodes resembled the shape of a horse-shoe, from which the story men- tioned by Pliny took its rise; and that the Fanesii (or, as the reading here has it, the Panotii, \"all-ears\") wore their hair very short, from which circumstance their ears appeared to be of a larger size than usual.",
      "17": "Tacitus speaks of three great groups of the German tribes, the Ingævones forming the first thereof, and consisting of those which dwelt on the margin of the ocean, the Hermiones in the interior, and the Istævones in the east and south of Germany. We shall presently find that Pliny adds two groups, the Vandili as the fourth, and the Peucini and Basternæ as the fifth. This classification however is thought to originate in a mistake, for Zeuss has satisfactorily shown that the Vandili belonged to the Hermiones, and that Peucini and Basternæ are only names of individual tribes and not of groups of tribes.",
      "18": "Brotier and other geographers are of opinion that by this name the chain of the Doffrefeld mountains is meant; but this cannot be the case if we suppose with Parisot that Pliny here returns south from the Scandinavian islands and takes his departure from Cape Rutt in the territory of the Ingævones. Still, it is quite impossible to say what mountains he would designate under the name of Sevo. Parisot suggests that it is a form of the compound word \"seevohner,\" \"inhabitants of the sea,\" and that it is a general name for the elevated lands along the margin of the sea-shore.",
      "19": "Parisot supposes that under this name the isle of Funen is meant, but it is more generally thought that Norway and Sweden are thus designated, as that peninsula was generally looked upon as an island by the ancients. The Codanian Gulf was the sea to the east of the Cimbrian Chersonesus or Jutland, filled with the islands which belong to the modern kingdom of Denmark. It was therefore the southern part of the Baltic.",
      "20": "By Eningia Hardouin thinks that the country of modern Finland is meant. Poinsinet thinks that under the name are included Ingria, Livonia, and Courland; while Parisot seems inclined to be of opinion that under this name the island of Zealand is meant, a village of which, about three-fourths of a league from the western coast, according to him, still bears the name of Heinïnge.",
      "21": "Parisot is of opinion that the Venedi, also called Vinidæ and Vindili, were of Sclavish origin, and situate on the shores of the Baltic. He remarks that this people, in the fifth century, founded in Pomerania, when quitted by the Goths, a kingdom, the chiefs of which styled themselves the Konjucs of Vinland. Their name is also to be found in Venden, a Russian town in the government of Riga, in Windenburg in Courland, and in Wenden in the circle of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Schwerin.",
      "22": "Parisot remarks that these two peoples were probably only tribes of the Venedi.",
      "23": "Parisot feels convinced that Pliny is speaking here of the Gulf of Travemunde, the island of Femeren, and then of the gulf which extends from that island to Kiel, where the Eider separates Holstein from Jutland. On the other hand, Hardouin thinks that by the Gulf of Cylipenus the Gulf of Riga is meant, and that Latris is the modern island of Oësel. But, as Parisot justly remarks, to put this construction on Pliny's language is to invert the order in which he has hitherto proceeded, evidently from east to west.",
      "24": "The modern Cape of Skagen on the north of Jutland.",
      "25": "When Drusus held the command in Germany, as we learn from Strabo, B. vii.",
      "26": "It is generally agreed that this is the modern island of Borkhum, at the mouth of the river Amaiius or Ems.",
      "27": "To a bean, from which (faba) the island had its name of Fabaria. In confirmation of this Hardouin states, that in his time there was a tower still standing there which was called by the natives Het boon huys, \"the bean house.\"",
      "28": "From the word gles or glas, which primarily means 'glass,' and then figuratively \"amber.\" Probably Œland and Gothland. They will be found again mentioned in the Thirtieth Chapter of the present Book. See p. 351."

      "The whole of the shores of this sea as far as the Scaldis<@1>, a river of Germany, is inhabited by nations, the dimensions of whose respective territories it is quite impossible to state, so immensely do the authors differ who have touched upon this subject. The Greek writers and some of our own countrymen have stated the coast of Germany to be 2500 miles in extent, while Agrippa, comprising Rhætia and Noricum in his estimate, makes the length to be 686<@2> miles, and the breadth 148<@3>. (14.) The breadth of Rhætia alone however very nearly exceeds that number of miles, and indeed we ought to state that it was only subjugated at about the period of the death of that general; while as for Germany, the whole of it was not thoroughly known to us for many years after his time. If I may be allowed to form a conjecture, the margin of the coast will be found to be not far short of the estimate of the Greek writers, while the distance in a straight line will nearly correspond with that mentioned by Agrippa.",
      "There are five German races; the Vandili<@4>, parts of whom are the Burgundiones<@5>, the Varini<@6>, the Carini<@7>, and the Gutones<@8>: the Ingævones, forming a second race, a portion of whom are the Cimbri<@9>, the Teutoni<@10>, and the tribes of the Chauci<@11>. The Istævones<@12>, who join up to the Rhine, and to whom the Cimbri<@13> belong, are the third race; while the Hermiones, forming a fourth, dwell in the interior, and include the Suevi<@14>, the Hermunduri<@15>, the Chatti<@16>, and the Cherusci<@17>: the fifth race is that of the Peucini<@18>, who are also the Basternæ, adjoining the Daci previously mentioned.

Parisot is of opinion that in forming this estimate Agrippa began at the angle formed by the river Piave in lat. 46°4′, measuring thence to Cape Rubeas (now Rutt) in lat. 54°25′. This would give 8°21′, to which, if we add some twenty leagues for obliquity or difference of longitude, the total would make exactly the distance here mentioned.",
      "3": "As Parisot remarks, it is totally impossible to conceive the source of such an erroneous conclusion as this. Some readings make the amount 248, others 268.",
      "4": "As already mentioned, Zeuss has satisfactorily shown that the Vandili or Vindili properly belonged to the Hermiones. Tacitus mentions but three groups of the German nations; the Ingævones on the ocean, the Hermiones in the interior, and the Istævones in the east and south of Germany. The Vandili, a Gothic race, dwelt originally on the northern coast of Germany, but afterwards settled north of the Marcomanni on the Riesengebirge. They subsequently appeared in Dacia and Pannonia, and in the beginning of the fifth century invaded Spain. Under Genseric they passed over into Africa, and finally took and plundered Rome in A.D. 455. Their kingdom was finally destroyed by Belisarius.",
      "5": "It is supposed that the Burgundiones were a Gothic people dwelling in the country between the rivers Viadus and Vistula, though Ammianus Marcellinus declares them to have been of pure Roman origin. How they came into the country of the Upper Maine in the south-west of Germany in A.D. 289, historians have found themselves at a loss to inform us. It is not improbable that the two peoples were not identical, and that the similarity of their name arose only from the circumstance that they both resided in \"burgi\" or burghs. See Gibbon, iii. 99. Bohn's Ed.",
      "6": "The Varini dwelt on the right bank of the Albis or Elbe, north of the Langobardi. Ptolemy however, who seems to mention them as the Avarini, speaks of them as dwelling near the sources of the Vistula, on the site of the present Cracow. See Gibbon, iv. 225. Bohn's Ed.",
      "7": "Nothing whatever is known of the locality of this people.",
      "8": "They are also called in history Gothi, Gothones, Gotones and Gutæ. According to Pytheas of Marseilles (as mentioned by Pliny, B. xxxvii. c. 2), they dwelt on the coasts of the Baltic, in the vicinity of what is now called the Fritsch-Haff. Tacitus also refers to the same district, though he does not speak of them as inhabiting the coast. Ptolemy again speaks of them as dwelling on the east of the Vistula, and to the south of the Venedi. The later form of their name, Gothi, does not occur till the time of Caracalla. Their native name was Gutthinda. They are first spoken of as a powerful nation at the beginning of the third century, when we find them mentioned as 'Getæ,' from the circumstance of their having occupied the countries formerly inhabited by the Sarmatian Getæ. The formidable attacks made by this people, divided into the nations of the Ostrogoths and Visigoths, upon the Roman power during its decline, are too well known to every reader of Gibbon to require further notice.",
      "9": "The inhabitants of Chersonesus Cimbrica, the modern peninsula of Jutland. It seems doubtful whether these Cimbri were a Germanic nation or a Celtic tribe, as also whether they were the same race whose numerous hordes successively defeated six Roman armies, and were finally conquered by C. Marius, B.C. 101, in the Campi Raudii. The more general impression, however, entertained by historians, is that they were a Celtic or Gallic and not a Germanic nation. The name is said to have signified \"robbers.\" See Gibbon, i. 273, iii. 365. Bohn's Ed.",
      "10": "The Teutoni or Teutones dwelt on the coasts of the Baltic, adjacent to the territory of the Cimbri. Their name, though belonging originally to a single nation or tribe, came to be afterwards applied collectively to the whole people of Germany. See Gibbon, iii. 139. Bohn's Ed.",
      "11": "Also called Cauchi, Cauci, and Cayci, a German tribe to the east of the Frisians, between the rivers Ems and Elbe. The modern Oldenburg and Hanover are supposed to pretty nearly represent the country of the Chauci. In B. xvi. c. 1. 2, will be found a further account of them by Pliny, who had visited their country, at least that part of it which lay on the sea-coast. They are mentioned for the last time in the third century, when they had extended so far south and west that they are spoken of as living on the banks of the Rhine.",
      "12": "Mentioned by Tacitus as dwelling in the east and south of Germany.",
      "13": "It has been suggested by Titzius that the words \"quorum Cimbri,\" \"to whom the Cimbri belong,\" are an interpolation; which is not improbable, or at least that the word \"Cimbri\" has been substituted for some other name.",
      "14": "This appears to be properly the collective name of a great number of the German tribes, who were of a migratory mode of life, and spoken of in opposition to the more settled tribes, who went under the general name of Ingævones. Cæsar speaks of them as dwelling east of the Ubii and Sygambri, and west of the Cherusci. Strabo makes them extend in an easterly direction beyond the Albis or Elbe, and southerly as far as the sources of the Danube. Tacitus gives the name of Suevia to the whole of the east of Germany, from the Danube to the Baltic. The name of the modern Suabia is derived from a body of adventurers from various German tribes, who assumed the name of Suevi in consequence of their not possessing any other appellation.",
      "15": "A large and powerful tribe of Germany, which occupied the extensive tract of country between the mountains in the north-west of Bohemia and the Roman Wall in the south-west, which formed the boundary of the Agri Decumates. On the east they bordered on the Narisci, on the north-east on the Cherusci, and on the north-west on the Chatti. There is little doubt that they originally formed part of the Suevi. At a later period they spread in a north-easterly direction, taking possession of the north-western part of Bohemia and the country about the sources of the Maine and Saale, that is, the part of Franconia as far as Kissingen and the south-western part of the kingdom of Saxony. The name Hermunduri is thought by some to signify highlanders, and to be a compound of Her or Ar, \"high,\" and Mund, \"man.\"",
      "16": "One of the great tribes of Germany, which rose to importance after the decay of the power of the Cherusci. It is thought by ethnographers that their name is still preserved in the word \"Hessen.\" They formed the chief tribe of the Hermiones here mentioned, and are described by Cæsar as belonging to the Suevi, though Tacitus distinguishes them, and no German tribe in fact occupied more permanently its original locality than the Chatti. Their original abode seems to have extended from the Wester- wald in the west to the Saale in Franconia, and from the river Maine in the south as far as the sources of the Elison and the Weser, so that they occupied exactly the modern country of Hessen, including perhaps a portion of the north-west of Bavaria. See Gibbon, vol. iii. 99. Bohn's Ed.",
      "17": "The Cherusci were the most celebrated of all the German tribes, and are mentioned by Cæsar as of the same importance as the Suevi, from whom they were separated by the Silva Bacensis. There is some difficulty in stating their exact locality, but it is generally supposed that their country extended from the Visurgis or Weser in the west to the Albis or Elbe in the east, and from Melibocus in the north to the neighbourhood of the Sudeti in the south, so that the Chamavi and Langobardi were their northern neighbours, the Chatti the western, the Hermunduri the southern, and the Silingi and Semnones their eastern neighbours. This tribe, under their chief Arminius or Hermann, forming a confederation with many smaller tribes in A.D. 9, completely defeated the Romans in the famous battle of the Teutoburg Forest. In later times they were conquered by the Chatti, so that Ptolemy speaks of them only as a small tribe on the south of the Hartz mountain. Their name afterwards appears, in the beginning of the fourth century, in the con federation of the Franks.",
      "18": "The Peucini are mentioned here, as also by Tacitus, as identical with the Basternæ. As already mentioned, supposing them to be names for distinct nations, they must be taken an only names of individual tribes, and not of groups of tribes. It is generally supposed that their first settlements in Sarmatia were in the highlands between the Theiss and the March, whence they passed onward to the lower Danube, as far as its mouth, where a portion of them, settling in the island of Peuce, obtained the name of Peucini. In the later geographers we find them settled between the Tyrus or Dniester, and the Borysthenes or Dnieper, the Peucini remaining at the mouth of the Danube.",
      "19": "According to Parisot, the Guttalus is the same as the Alle, a tributary of the Pregel. Cluver thinks that it is the same as the Oder. Other writers again consider it the same as the Pregel.",

      "21": "Now the Weser.",
      "22": "The modern Ems.",
      "23": "The Meuse.",
      "24": "The 'Hercynia Silva,' Hercynian Forest or Range, is very differently described by the writers of various ages. The earliest mention of it is by Aristotle. Judging from the accounts given by Cæsar, Pomponius Mela, and Strabo, the 'Hercynia Silva' appears to have been a general name for almost all the mountains of Southern and Central Germany, that is, from the sources of the Danube to Transylvania, comprising the Schwarzwald, Odenwald, Spessart, Rhön, Thuringer Wald, the Hartz mountain (which seems in a great measure to have retained the ancient name), Raube Alp, Steigerwald, Fichtelgebirge, Erzgebirge, and Riesengebirge. At a later period when the mountains of Germany had become better known, the name was applied to the more limited range extending around Bohemia, and through Moravia into Hungary."

These are the names of the mouths into which the Rhine divides itself, discharging its waters on the north into the lakes there, and on the west into the river Mosa.

The Waal or Vahalis seems to have undergone considerable changes, and the place of its junction with the Maas may have varied. Pliny makes the island nearly 100 miles in length, which is about the distance from the fort of Schenkenschanz, where the first separation of the Rhine takes place, to the mouth of the Maas. The name of Batavia was no doubt the genuine name, which is still preserved in Betuwe, the name of a district at the bifurcation of the Rhine and the Waal. The Canninefates, a people of the same race as the Batavi, also occupied the island, and as the Batavi seem to have been in the eastern part, it is supposed that the Canninefates occupied the western. They were subdued by Tiberius in the reign of Augustus.",
      "2": "The Frisii or Frisones were one of the great tribes of north-western Germany, properly belonging to the group of the Ingævones. They in- habited the country about Lake Flevo and other lakes, between the Rhine and the Ems, so as to be bounded on the south by the Bructeri, and on the east by the Chauci. Tacitus distinguishes between the Frisii Majores and Minores, and it is supposed that the latter dwelt on the east of the canal of Drusus in the north of Holland, and the former between the rivers Flevus and Amisia, that is, in the country which still bears the name of Friesland. The Chauci have been previously mentioned.",

      "6": "Probably the same as the modern Vlieland (thus partly retaining its ancient name), an island north of the Texel. The more ancient writers speak of two main arms, into which the Rhine was divided on entering the territory of the Batavi, of which the one on the east continued to bear the name of Rhenus, while that on the west into which the Masa, Maas or Meuse, flowed, was called Vahalis or Waal. After Drusus, B.C. 12, had connected the Flevo Lacus or Zuvder-Zee with the Rhine by means of a canal, in forming which he probably made use of the bed of the Yssel, we find mention made of three mouths of the Rhine. Of these the names, as given by Pliny, are, on the west, Helium (the Yahalis of other writers), in the centre Rhenus, and at the north Flevum; but at a later period we again find mention made of only two mouths."

      "Opposite to this coast is the island called Britannia, so celebrated in the records of Greece<@1> and of our own country. It is situate to the north-west, and, with a large tract of intervening sea, lies opposite to Germany, Gaul, and Spain, by far the greater part of Europe. Its former name was Albion<@2>; but at a later period, all the islands, of which we shall just now briefly make mention, were included under the name of \"Britanniæ.\" This island is distant from Gesoriacum, on the coast of the nation of the Morini<@3>, at the spot where the passage across is the shortest, fifty miles. Pytheas and Isidorus say that its circumference is 4875 miles. It is barely thirty years since any extensive knowledge of it was gained by the successes of the Roman arms, and even as yet they have not penetrated beyond the vicinity of the Caledonian<@4> forest. Agrippa believes its length to be 800 miles, and its breadth 300; he also thinks that the breadth of Hibernia is the same, but that its length is less by 200 miles. This last island is situate beyond Britannia, the passage across being the shortest from the territory of the Silures<@5>, a distance of thirty miles. Of the remaining islands none is said to have a greater circumference than 125 miles. Among these there are the Orcades<@6>, forty in number, and situate within a short distance of each other, the seven islands called Acmodæ<@7>, the Hæbudes, thirty in number, and, between Hibernia and Britannia, the islands of Mona<@8>, Monapia<@9>, Ricina<@10>, Vectis<@11>, Limnus<@12>, and Andros<@13>. Below it are the islands called Samnis and Axantos<@14>, and opposite, scattered in the German Sea, are those known as the Glæsariæ<@15>, but which the Greeks have more recently called the Electrides, from the circumstance of their producing electrum or amber. The most remote of all that we find mentioned is Thule<@16>, in which, as we have previously stated<@17>, there is no night at the summer solstice, when the sun is passing through the sign of Cancer, while on the other hand at the winter solstice there is no day. Some writers are of opinion that this state of things lasts for six whole months together. Timæus the historian says that an island called Mictis<@18> is within six days' sail of Britannia, in which white load<@19> is found; and that the Britons sail over to it in boats of osier<@20>, covered with sewed hides. There are writers also who make mention of some other islands, Scandia<@21> namely, Dumna, Bergos, and, greater than all, Nerigos, from which persons embark for Thule. At one day's sail from Thule is the frozen ocean, which by some is called the Cronian Sea."

Parisot remarks that off the West Cape of the Isle of Skye and the Isle of North Uist, the nearest of the Hebrides to the Shetland islands, there is a vast gulf filled with islands, which still bears the name of Mamaddy or Maddy, from which the Greeks may have easily derived the words αἱ μαδδαὶ, whence the Latin Hæmodæ.",

      "16": "The opinions as to the identity of ancient Thule have been numerous in the extreme. We may here mention six:—1. The common, and apparently the best founded opinion, that Thule is the island of Iceland. 2. That it is either the Ferroe group, or one of those islands. 3. The notion of Ortelius, Farnaby, and Schœnning, that it is identical with Thylemark in Norway. 4. The opinion of Malte Brun, that the continental portion of Denmark is meant thereby, a part of which is to the present day called Thy or Thyland. 5. The opinion of Rudbeck and of Calstron, borrowed originally from Procopius, that this is a general name for the whole of Scandinavia. 6. That of Gosselin, who thinks that under this name Mainland, the principal of the Shetland Islands, is meant. It is by no means impossible that under the name of Thule two or more of these localities may have been meant, by different authors writing at distant periods and under different states of geographical knowledge. It is also pretty generally acknowledged, as Parisot remarks, that the Thule mentioned by Ptolemy is identical with Thylemark in Norway.",
      "17": "B. ii. c. 77.",
      "18": "Brotier thinks that under this name a part of Cornwall is meant, and that it was erroneously supposed to be an island. Parisot is of opinion that the copyists, or more probably Pliny himself, has made an error in transcribing Mictis for Vectis, the name of the Isle of Wight. It is not improbable however that the island of Mictis had only an imaginary existence.",

      "21": "Brotier, with many other writers, takes these names to refer to various parts of the coast of Norway. Scandia he considers to be the same as Scania, Bergos the modern Bergen, and Nerigos the northern part of Norway. On the other hand, Gosselin is of opinion that under the name of Bergos the Scottish island of Barra is meant, and under that of Nerigos, the island of Lewis, the northern promontory of which is in the old maps designated by the name of Nary or Nery. Ptolemy makes mention of an island called Doumna in the vicinity of the Orcades."

    "paragraphs": [
      "At the Promontory of the Pyrenees Spain begins, more narrow, not only than Gaul, but even than itself<@1> in its other parts, as we have previously mentioned<@2>, seeing to what an immense extent it is here hemmed in by the ocean on the one side, and by the Iberian Sea on the other. A chain of the Pyrenees, extending from due east to south-west<@3>, divides Spain into two parts, the smaller one to the north, the larger to the south. The first coast that presents itself is that of the Nearer Spain, otherwise called Tarraconensis. On leaving the Pyrenees and proceeding along the coast, we meet with the forest ranges of the Vascones<@4>, Olarso<@5>, the towns of the Varduli<@6>, the Morosgi<@7>, Menosca<@8>, Vesperies<@9>, and the Port of Amanus<@10>, where now stands the colony of Flaviobriga. We then come to the district of the nine states of the Cantabri<@11>, the river Sauga<@12>, and the Port of Victoria of the Juliobrigenses<@13>, from which place the sources of the Iberus<@14> are distant forty miles. We next come to the Port of Blendium<@15>, the Orgenomesci<@16>, a people of the Cantabri, Vereasueca<@17> their port, the country of the As- tures<@18>, the town of Noega<@19>, and on a peninsula<@20>, the Pæsici. Next to these we have, belonging to the jurisdiction of Lucus<@21>, after passing the river Navilubio<@22>, the Cibarci<@23>, the Egovarri, surnamed Namarini, the Iadoni, the Arrotrebæ<@24>, the Celtic Promontory, the rivers Florius<@25> and Nelo, the Celtici<@26>, surnamed Neri, and above them the Tamarici<@27>, in whose peninsula<@28> are the three altars called Sestianæ, and dedicated<@29> to Augustus; the Capori<@30>, the town of Noela<@31>, the Celtici surnamed Præsamarci, and the Cilen<@32>: of the islands, those worthy of mention are Corticata<@33> and Aunios. After passing the Cileni, belonging to the jurisdiction of the Bracari<@34>, we have the Heleni<@35>, the Gravii<@36>, and the fortress of Tyde, all of them deriving their origin from the Greeks. Also, the islands called Cicæ<@37>, the famous city of Abobrica<@38>, the river Minius<@39>, four miles wide at its mouth, the Leuni, the Seurbi<@40>, and Augusta<@41>, a town of the Bracari, above whom lies Gallæcia. We then come to the river Limia<@42>, and the river Durius<@43>, one of the largest in Spain, and which rises in the district of the Pelendones<@44>, passes near Numantia, and through the Arevaci and the Vaccæi, dividing the Vettones from Asturia, the Gallæci from Lusitania, and separating the Turduli from the Bracari. The whole of the region here mentioned from the Pyrenees is full of mines of gold, silver, iron, and lead, both black and white<@45>."

      "After passing the Durius, Lusitania<@1> begins. We here have the ancient Turdul<@2>, the Pæsuri, the river Vaga<@3>, the town of Talabrica, the town and river<@4> of Æminium, the towns of Conimbrica<@5>, Collippo<@6>, and Eburobritium<@7>. A promontory<@8> then advances into the sea in shape of a large horn; by some it has been called Artabrum<@9>, by others the Great Promon- tory, while many call it the Promontory of Olisipo, from the city<@10> near it. This spot forms a dividing line in the land, the sea, and the heavens. Here ends one side<@11> of Spain; and, when we have doubled the promontory, the front of Spain begins. (22.) On one side of it lie the North and the Gallic Ocean, on the other the West and the Atlantic. The length of this promontory has been estimated by some persons at sixty miles, by others at ninety. A considerable number of writers estimate the distance from this spot to the Pyrenees at 1250 miles; and, committing a manifest error, place here the nation of the Artabri, a nation that never<@12> was here. For, making a slight change in the name, they have placed at this spot the Arrotrebæ, whom we have previously spoken of as dwelling in front of the Celtic Promontory.",
      "Mistakes have also been made as to the more celebrated rivers. From the Minius, which we have previously mentioned, according to Varro, the river Æminius<@13> is distant 200 miles, which others<@14> suppose to be situate elsewhere, and called Limæa. By the ancients it was called the \"River of Oblivion,\" and it has been made the subject of many fabulous stories. At a distance of 200 miles from the Durius is the Tagus, the Munda<@15> lying between them. The Tagus is famous for its golden sands<@16>. At a distance of 160 miles from it is the Sacred Promontory<@17>, projecting from nearly the very middle of the front<@18> of Spain. From this spot to the middle of the Pyrenees, Varro says, is a distance of 1400 miles; while to the Anas, by which we have mentioned<@19> Lusitania as being separated from Bætica, is 126 miles, it being 102 more to Gades.",
      "The peoples are the Celtici, the Turduli, and, about the Tagus, the Vettones<@20>. From the river Anas to the Sacred Promontory<@21> are the Lusitani. The cities worthy of mention on the coast, beginning from the Tagus, are that of Olisipo<@22>, famous for its mares, which conceive<@23> from the west wind; Salacia<@24>, which is surnamed the Imperial City; Merobrica<@25>; and then the Sacred Promontory, with the other known by the name of Cuneus<@26>, and the towns of Ossonoba<@27>, Balsa<@28>, and Myrtili<@29>.",
      "The whole of this province is divided into three jurisdictions, those of Emerita, Pax, and Scalabis. It contains in all forty-six peoples, among whom there are five colonies, one municipal town of Roman citizens, three with the ancient Latin rights, and thirty-six that are tributaries. The colonies are those of Augusta Emerita<@30>, situate on the river Anas, Metallinum<@31>, Pax<@32>, and Norba<@33>, surnamed Cæsariana. To this last place of jurisdiction the people of Castra Servilia<@34> and Castra Cæcilia<@35> resort. The fifth jurisdiction is that of Scalabis<@36>, which also has the name of Præsidium Julium<@37>. Olisipo, surnamed Felicitas Julia<@38>, is a municipal city, whose inhabitants enjoy the rights of Roman citizens. The towns in the enjoyment of the ancient Latin rights are Ebora<@39>, which also has the name of Liberalitas Julia<@40>, and Myrtili and Salacia, which we have previously mentioned. Those among the tributaries whom it may not be amiss to mention, in addition to those already<@41> alluded to among the names of those in Bætica, are the Augustobrigenses<@42>, the Ammienses<@43>, the Aranditani, the Arabricenses, the Balsenses, the Cesarobricenses, the Caperenses<@44>, the Caurenses<@45>, the Colarni, the Cibilitani, the Concordienses<@46>, the Elbocorii, the Interannienses, the Lan- cienses<@47>, the Mirobrigenses, surnamed<@48> Celtici, the Medubrigenses<@49>, surnamed Plumbarii, the Ocelenses<@50> or Lancienses, the Turduli, also called Barduli, and the Tapori. Agrippa states, that Lusitania, with Asturia and Gallæcia, is 540 miles in length, and 536 in breadth. The provinces of Spain, measured from the two extreme<@51> promontories of the Pyrenees, along the sea-line of the entire coast, are thought to be 3922 miles in circumference; while some writers make them to be but 2600."

He mentions a promontory called Artabrum as the headland at the N. W. extremity of Spain; the coast on the one side of it looking to the north and the Gallic Ocean, on the other to the west and the Atlantic Ocean. But he considers this promontory to be the west headland of the estuary of the Tagus, and adds, that some called it Magnum Promontorium, or the \"Great Promontory,\" and others Olisiponense, from the city of Olisipo, or Lisbon. He assigns, in fact, all the west coast of Spain, down to the mouth of the Tagus, to the north coast, and, instead of being led to detect his error by the resemblance of name between his Artabrum Promontorium and his Arrotrebæ (the Artabri of his predecessors, Strabo and Mela), he perversely finds fault with those who had placed above the promontory Artabrum, a people of the same name who never were there.",

At the very commencement of Bætica, and twenty-five miles from the mouth of the Straits of Gades, is the island of Gadis, twelve miles long and three broad, as Polybius states in his writings. At its nearest part, it is less than 700 feet<@4> distant from the mainland, while in the remaining portion it is distant more than seven miles. Its circuit is fifteen miles, and it has on it a city which enjoys the rights of Roman citizens<@5>, and whose people are called the Augustani of the city of Julia Gaditana. On the side which looks towards Spain, at about 100 paces distance, is another long island, three miles wide, on which the original city of Gades stood. By Ephorus and Philistides it is called Erythia, by Timæus and Silenus Aphrodisias<@6>, and by the natives the Isle of Juno. Timæus says, that the larger island used to be called Cotinusa<@7>, from its olives; the Romans call it Tartessos<@8>; the Carthaginians Gadir<@9>, that word in the Punic language signifying a hedge. It was called Erythia because the Tyrians, the original an- cestors of the Carthaginians, were said to have come from the Erythræn, or Red Sea. In this island Geryon is by some thought to have dwelt, whose herds were carried off by Hercules.

Thus we find Strabo, in B. iii., saying, that \"the Cassiterides are ten in number, lying near each other in the ocean, towards the north from the haven of the Artabri.\" From a comparison of the accounts, it would almost appear that the ancient geographers confused the Scilly Islands with the Azores, as those, who enter into any detail, attribute to the Cassiterides the characteristics almost as much of the Azores and the sea in their vicinity, as of the Scilly Islands.",

The earliest Greek poetry places the abode of the happy departed spirits far beyond the entrance of the Mediterranean, at the extremity of the earth, and upon the shores of the river Oceanus, or in islands in its midst; and Horner's poetical description of the place may be applied almost word for word to those islands in the Atlantic, off the west coast of Africa, to which the name was given in the historical period. (Od. iv. 1. 563, seq.) 'There the life of mortals is most easy; there is no snow, nor winter, nor much rain, but Ocean is ever sending up the shrill breathing breezes of Zephyrus to refresh men.' Their delicious climate, and their supposed identity of situation, marked out the Canary Islands, the Madeira group, and the Azores, as worthy to represent the Islands of the Blest. In the more specific sense, however, the name was applied to the two former groups; while, in its widest application, it may have even included the Cape de Verde Islands, its extension being in fact adapted to that of maritime discovery.\" Pliny gives a further description of them in B. vi. c. 37.",

Polybius in his writings has stated the breadth of Europe, in a line from Italy to the ocean, to be 1150 miles. But, even in his day, its magnitude was but little known. The distance of Italy, as we have previously<@1> stated, as far as the Alps, is 1120 miles, from which, through Lugdunum to the British port of the Morini<@2>, the direction which Polybius seems to follow, is 1168 miles. But the better ascertained, though greater length, is that taken from the Alps through the Camp of the Legions<@3> in Germany, in a north-westerly direction, to the mouth of the Rhine, being 1543 miles. We shall now have to speak of Africa and Asia.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "The Greeks have given the name of Libya<@1> to Africa, and have called the sea that lies in front of it the Libyan Sea. It has Egypt for its boundary, and no part of the earth is there that has fewer gulfs or inlets, its shores extending in a lengthened line from the west in an oblique direction. The names of its peoples, and its cities in especial, cannot possibly be pronounced with correctness, except by the aid of their own native tongues. Its population, too, for the most part dwells only in fortresses<@2>.",
      "(1.) On our entrance into Africa, we find the two Mauritanias, which, until the time of Caius Cæsar<@3>, the son of Germanicus, were kingdoms; but, suffering under his cruelty, they were divided into two provinces. The extreme promontory of Africa, which projects into the ocean, is called Ampelusia<@4> by the Greeks. There were formerly two towns, Lissa and Cotte<@5>, beyond the Pillars of Hercules; but, at the present day, we only find that of Tingi<@6>, which was for- merly founded by Antæus, and afterwards received the name of Traducta Julia<@7>, from Claudius Cæsar, when he established a colony there. It is thirty miles distant from Belon<@8>, a town of Bætica, where the passage across is the shortest. At a distance of twenty-five miles from Tingi, upon the shores of the ocean<@9>, we come to Julia Constantia Zilis<@10>, a colony of Augustus. This place is exempt from all subjection to the kings of Mauritania, and is included in the legal jurisdiction of Bætica. Thirty-two miles distant from Julia Constantia is Lixos<@11>, which was made a Roman colony by Claudius Cæsar, and which has been the subject of such wondrous fables, related by the writers of antiquity. At this place, according to the story, was the palace of Antaeus; this was the scene of his combat with Hercules, and here were the gardens of the Hesperides<@12>. An arm of the sea flows into the land here, with a serpentine channel, and, from the nature of the locality, this is interpreted at the present day as having been what was really represented by the story of the dragon keeping guard there. This tract of water surrounds an island, the only spot which is never overflowed by the tides of the sea, although not quite so elevated as the rest of the land in its vicinity. Upon this island, also, there is still in existence the altar of Hercules; but of the grove that bore the golden fruit, there are no traces left, beyond some wild olive-trees. People will certainly be the less surprised at the marvellous falsehoods of the Greeks, which have been related about this place and the river Lixos<@13>, when they reflect that some of our own<@14> countrymen as well, and that too very recently, have related stories in reference to them hardly less monstrous; how that this city is remarkable for its power and extensive influence, and how that it is even greater than Great Carthage ever was; how, too, that it is situate just opposite to Carthage, and at an almost immeasurable distance from Tingi, together with other details of a similar nature, all of which Cornelius Nepos has believed with the most insatiate credulity<@15>.",
      "In the interior, at a distance of forty miles from Lixos, is Babba<@16>, surnamed Julia Campestris, another colony of Augustus; and, at a distance of seventy-five, a third, called Banasa<@17>, with the surname of Valentia. At a distance of thirty-five miles from this last is the town of Volubilis, which is just that distance also from both<@18> seas. On the coast, at a distance of fifty miles from Lixos, is the river Subur<@19>, which flows past the colony of Banasa, a fine river, and available for the purposes of navigation. At the same distance from it is the city of Sala<@20>, situate on a river which bears the same name, a place which stands upon the very verge of the desert, and though infested by troops of elephants, is much more exposed to the attacks of the nation of the Autololes, through whose country lies the road to Mount Atlas, the most fabulous<@21> locality even in Africa.",
      "It is from the midst of the sands, according to the story, that this mountain<@22> raises its head to the heavens; rugged and craggy on the side which looks toward the shores of the ocean to which it has given its name, while on that which faces the interior of Africa it is shaded by dense groves of trees, and refreshed by flowing streams; fruits of all kinds springing up there spontaneously to such an extent, as to more than satiate every possible desire. Throughout the daytime, no inhabitant is to be seen; all is silent, like that dreadful stillness which reigns in the desert. A religious horror steals imperceptibly over the feelings of those who approach, and they feel themselves smitten with awe at the stupendous aspect of its summit, which reaches beyond the clouds, and well nigh approaches the very orb of the moon. At night, they say, it gleams with fires innumerable lighted up; it is then the scene of the gambols of the Ægipans<@23> and the Satyr crew, while it re-echoes with the notes of the flute and the pipe, and the clash of drums and cymbals. All this is what authors of high character have stated, in addition to the labours which Hercules and Perseus there experienced. The space which intervenes before you arrive at this mountain is immense, and the country quite unknown.",
      "There formerly existed some Commentaries written by Hanno<@24>, a Carthaginian general, who was commanded, in the most flourishing times of the Punic state, to explore the sea-coast of Africa. The greater part of the Greek and Roman writers have followed him, and have related, among other fabulous stories, that many cities there were founded by him, of which no remembrance, nor yet the slightest vestige, now exists.",
      "While Scipio Æmilianus held the command in Sicily, Polybius the historian received a fleet from him for the purpose of proceeding on a voyage of discovery in this part of the world. He relates, that beyond<@25> Mount Atlas, pro- ceeding in a westerly direction, there are forests filled with wild beasts, peculiar to the soil of Africa, as far as the river Anatis<@26>, a distance of 485 miles, Lixos being distant from it 205 miles. Agrippa says, that Lixos is distant from the Straits of Gades 112 miles. After it we come to a gulf which is called the Gulf of Saguti<@27>, a town situate on the Promontory of Mulelacha<@28>, the rivers Subur and Salat<@29>, and the port of Rutubis<@30>, distant from Lixos 213 miles We then come to the Promontory of the Sun<@31>, the port of Risardir<@32>, the Gætulian Autololes, the river Cosenus<@33>, the nations of the Selatiti and the Masati, the river Masathat<@34>, and the river Darat<@35>, in which crocodiles are found. After this we come to a large gulf, 616<@36> miles in extent, which is enclosed by a promontory of Mount Barce<@37>, which runs out in a westerly direction, and is called Surrentium<@38>. Next comes the river Salsus<@39>, beyond which lie the Æthiopian Perorsi, at the back of whom are the Pharusii<@40>, who are bordered upon by the Gætulian Daræ<@41>, lying in the interior. Upon the coast again, we find the Æthiopian Daratitæ, and the river Bambotus<@42>, teeming with crocodiles and hippopotami. From this river there is a continuous range<@43> of mountains till we come to the one which is known by the name of Theon Ochema<@44>, from which to the Hesperian Promontory<@45> is a voyage of ten days and nights; and in the middle of this space he<@46> has placed Mount Atlas, which by all other writers has been stated to be in the extreme parts of Mauritania.",
      "The Roman arms, for the first time, pursued their conquests into Mauritania, under the Emperor Claudius, when the freedman Ædemon took up arms to avenge the death of King Ptolemy<@47>, who had been put to death by Caius Cæsar; and it is a well-known fact, that on the flight of the barbarians our troops reached Mount Atlas. It became a boast, not only among men of consular rank, and generals selected from the senate, who at that time held the command, but among persons of equestrian rank as well, who after that period held the government there, that they had penetrated as far as Mount Atlas. There are, as we have already stated, five Roman colonies in this province; and it may very possibly appear, if we listen only to what report says, that this mountain is easily accessible. Upon trial, however, it has been pretty generally shown, that all such statements are utterly fallacious; and it is too true, that men in high station, when they are disinclined to take the trouble of inquiring into the truth, through a feeling of shame at their ignorance arc not averse to be guilty of falsehood; and never is implicit credence more readily given, than when a falsehood is supported by the authority of some personage of high consideration. For my own part, I am far less surprised that there are still some facts remaining undiscovered by men of the equestrian order, and even those among them who have attained senatorial rank, than that the love of luxury has left anything unascertained; the impulse of which must be great indeed, and most powerfully felt, when the very forests are ransacked for their ivory and citron-wood<@48>, and all the rocks of Gætulia are searched for the murex and the purple.",
      "From the natives, however, we learn, that on the coast, at a distance of 150 miles from the Salat, the river Asana<@49> presents itself; its waters are salt, but it is remarkable for its fine harbour. They also say that after this we come to a river known by the name of Fut<@50>, and then, after crossing another called Vior which lies on the road, at a distance of 200 miles we arrive at Dyris<@51>, such being the name which in their language they give to Mount Atlas. According to their story there are still existing in its vicinity many vestiges which tend to prove that the locality was once inhabited; such as the remains of vineyards and plantations of palm-trees.",
      "Suetonius Paulinus<@52>, whom we have seen Consul in our own time, was the first Roman general who advanced a distance of some miles beyond Mount Atlas. He has given us the same information as we have received from other sources with reference to the extraordinary height of this mountain, and at the same time he has stated that all the lower parts about the foot of it are covered with dense and lofty forests composed of trees of species hitherto unknown. The height of these trees, he says, is remarkable; the trunks are without knots, and of a smooth and glossy surface; the foliage is like that of the cypress, and besides sending forth a powerful odour, they are covered with a flossy down, from which, by the aid of art, a fine cloth might easily be manufactured, similar to the textures made from the produce of the silk-worm. He informs us that the summit of this mountain is covered with snow even in summer, and says that having arrived there after a march of ten days, he proceeded some distance beyond it as far as a river which bears the name of Ger<@53>; the road being through deserts covered with a black sand<@54>, from which rocks that bore the appearance of having been exposed to the action of fire, projected every here and there; localities rendered quite uninhabitable by the intensity of the heat, as he himself experienced, although it was in the winter season that he visited them. We also learn from the same source that the people who inhabit the adjoining forests, which are full of all kinds of elephants, wild beasts, and serpents, have the name of Canarii; from the circumstance that they partake of their food in common with the canine race, and share with it the entrails of wild beasts.",
      "It is a well-known fact, that adjoining to these localities is a nation of Æthiopians, which bears the name of Perorsi. Juba, the father of Ptolemy, who was the first king<@55> who reigned over both the Mauritanias, and who has been rendered even more famous by the brilliancy of his learning than by his kingly rank, has given us similar information relative to Mount Atlas, and states that a certain herb grows there, which has received the name of 'euphorbia'<@56> from that of his physician, who was the first to discover it. Juba extols with wondrous praises the milky juice of this plant as tending to improve the sight, and acting as a specific against the bites of serpents and all kinds of poison; and to this subject alone he has devoted an entire book. Thus much, if indeed not more than enough, about Mount Atlas.",
      "(2.) The province of Tingitana is 170 miles in length<@57>. Of the nations in this province the principal one was formerly that of the Mauri<@58>, who have given to it the name of Mauritania, and have been by many writers called the Maurusii<@59>. This nation has been greatly weakened by the disasters of war, and is now dwindled down to a few families only<@60>. Next to the Mauri was formerly the nation of the Massæsyli<@61>; they in a similar manner have become extinct. Their country is now occupied by the Gætulian nations<@62>, the Baniuræ<@63>, the Autololes<@64>, by far the most powerful people among them all, and the Vesuni, who formerly were a part of the Autololes, but have now separated from them, and, turning their steps towards the Æthiopians<@65>, have formed a distinct nation of their own. This province, in the mountainous district which lies on its eastern side produces elephants, as also on the heights of Mount Abyla<@66> and among those elevations which, from the similarity of their height, are called the Seven Brothers<@67>. Joining the range of Abyla these mountains overlook the Straits of Gades. At the extremity of this chain begin the shores of the inland sea<@68> and we come to the Tamuda<@69>, a navigable stream, with the site of a former town of the same name, and then the river Laud<@70>, which is also navigable for vessels, the town and port of Rhysaddir<@71>, and Malvane<@72>, a navigable stream.",
      "The city of Siga<@73>, formerly the residence of King Syphax, lies opposite to that of Malaca<@74> in Spain: it now belongs to the second<@75> Mauritania. But these countries, I should remark, for a long time retained the names of their respective kings, the further Mauritania being called the \"land of Bogud<@76>,\" while that which is now called Cæsariensis was called the \"country of Bocchus.\" After passing Siga we come to the haven called \"Portus Magnus<@77>\" from its great extent, with a town whose people enjoy the rights of Roman citizens, and then the river Mulucha<@78>, which served as the limit between the territory of Bocchus and that of the Massæsyli. Next to this is Quiza Xenitana<@79>, a town founded by strangers, and Arsenaria<@80>, a place with the ancient Latin rights, three miles distant from the sea. We then come to Cartenna<@81>, a colony founded under Augustus by the second legion, and Gunugum<@82>, another colony founded by the same emperor, a prætorian cohort being established there; the Promontory of Apollo<@83>, and a most celebrated city, now called Cæsarea<@84>, but formerly known by the name of Iol; this place was the residence of King Juba, and received the rights of a colony from the now deified Emperor Claudius. Oppidum Novum<@85> is the next place; a colony of veterans was established here by command of the same emperor. Next to it is Tipasa<@86>, which has received Latin rights, as also Icasium<@87>, which has been presented by the Emperor Vespasianus with similar rights; Rusconiæ<@88>, a colony founded by Augustus; Rusucurium<@89>, honoured by Claudius with the rights of Roman citizens; Ruzacus<@90>, a colony founded by Augustus; Salde<@91>, another colony founded by the same emperor; Igilgili<@92>, another; and the town of Tucca<@93>, situate on the sea-shore and upon the river Ampsaga. In the interior are the colony of Augusta, also called Succabar<@94>, Tubusuptus<@95>, the cities of Timici and Tigavæ<@96>, the rivers Sardabal<@97>, Aves<@98>, and Nabar<@99>, the nation of the Macurebi, the river Usar<@100>, and the nation of the Nababes. The river Ampsaga is distant from Cæsarea 322<@101> miles. The length of the two Mauritanias is 1038, and their breadth 467 miles."

His tomb, which formed a hill, in the shape of a man stretched out at full length, was shown near the town of Tingis to a late period. It was also believed, that whenever a portion of the earth covering the body was taken away, it rained until the hole was filled up again. Sertorius is said to have dug away a portion of the hill; but, on discovering a skeleton sixty cubits in length, he was struck with horror, and had it immediately covered again. Procopius says, that the fortress of this place was built by the Canaanites, who were driven by the Jews out of Palestine.",

It is more probable, however, that Claudius, at a later period, ordered it to be called \"Traducta Julia,\" or \"the removed Colony of Julia,\" in remembrance of a colony having proceeded thence to Spain in the time of Julius Cæsar. Claudius himself, as stated in the text, established a colony here.",

D'Anville suggests that it may be Old Mahmora, on the coast; but, on the other hand, Ptolemy places it among the inland cities, assigning to it a longitude at some distance from the sea. Pliny also appears to make it inland, and makes its distance from Lixos seventy-five miles, while he makes the mouth of the Subur to be fifty miles from the same place.",

More usually, there is but one Ægipan mentioned,—the son, according to Hyginus, of Zeus or Jupiter, and a goat,—or of Zeus and Æga, the wife of Pan. As a foundation for one part of the stories here men- tioned, Brotier suggests the fact, that as the Kabyles, or mountain tribes, are in the habit of retiring to their dwellings and reposing during the heat of the day, it would not, consequently, be improbable that they would devote the night to their amusements, lighting up fires, and dancing to the music of drums and cymbals.",
      "24": "Under his name we still possess a \"Periplus,\" or account of a voyage round a part of Libya. The work was originally written in Punic, but what has come down to us is a Greek translation. We fail, however, to discover any means by which to identify him with any one of the many Carthaginians of the same name. Some writers call him king, and others dux, or imperator of the Carthaginians; from which we may infer, that he held the office of suffetes. This expedition has by some been placed as far back as the time of the Trojan war, or of Hesiod, while others again place it as late as the reign of Agathocles. Falconer, Bougainville, and Gail, place the time of Hanno at about B.C. 570, while other critics identify him with Hanno, the father or son of Hamilcar, who was killed at Himera, B.C. 480. Pliny often makes mention of him; more particularly see B. viii. c. 21.",

      "42": "Supposed by Gosselin to be the present river Nun, or Non. According to Bochart, this river received its name from the Hebrew or Phoenician word behemoth or bamoth, the name by which Job (xl. 15) calls the crocodile [or rather the hippopotamus]. Bochart, however, with Mannert, Bougainville, De Rennet, and De Heeren, is of opinion, that by this name the modern river Senegal is meant. Marcus is of opinion that it is either the Non or the modern Sobi.",
      "43": "Marcus here observes, that from Cape Alfach, below Cape Non, there are no mountains, but continual wastes of sand, bordering on the sea-shore. Indeed there is no headland, of any considerable height, between Cape Sobi and Cape Bajador.",

      "47": "Ptolemy the son of Juba II. and Cleopatra, was summoned to Rome in the year A.D. 40, by Caligula, and shortly after put to death by him, his riches having excited the emperor's cupidity. Previously to this, he had been on terms of strict alliance with the Roman people, who had decreed him a toga picta and a sceptre, as a mark of their friendship.",

While Proprætor in Mauritania under the Emperor Claudius, in the year A.D. 42, he defeated the Mauri who had risen in revolt, and advanced, as Pliny here states, as far as Mount Atlas. It is not known from what point Paulinus made his advance towards the Atlas range. Mannert and Marcus are of opinion that he set out from Sala, the modern Sallee, while Latreille, Malte Brun, and Walkenaer think that his point of departure was the mouth of the river Lixos. Sala was the most southerly town on the western coast of Africa that in the time of Pliny had submitted to the Roman arms.",
      "53": "Some of the editions read 'Niger' here. Marcus suggests that that river may have been called 'Niger' by the Phœnician or Punic colonists of the western Mauritania, and 'Ger' or' Gar' in another quarter. The same writer also suggests that the Sigilmessa was the river to which Paulinus penetrated on his march beyond Atlas.",

      "59": "Maursii' was the Greek name, 'Mauri' the Latin, for this people. Marcus suggests that Mauri was a synonym only for the Greek word nomades, 'wanderers.'",
      "60": "As Marcus observes, Pliny is here greatly in error. On the inroads of Paulinus, the Mauri had retreated into the interior and taken refuge in the deserts of Zahara, whence they had again emerged in the time of the geographer Ptolemy.",
      "61": "From the time of the second Punic War this people had remained in undisputed possession of the country situate between the rivers Molochath or Moluga and Ampsaga, which formed the Cæsarian Mauritania.

Their city of Autolala or Autolalæ is one of Ptolemy's points of astronomical observation, having the longest day thirteen hours and a half, being distant three hours and a half west of Alexandria, and having the sun vertical once a year, at the time of the winter solstice.

D'Anville, Mannert and others identify it with Scherchell or Zershell, thus placing it too far west. Mannert was evidently misled by an error in the Antonine Itinerary, whereby all the places along this coast are, for a considerable distance, thrown too far to the west; the researches however which followed the French conquest of the country have revealed inscriptions which completely set the question at rest.",

The Roman senate afterwards annulled this with the other acts of Gracchus. Under Augustus however the new city of Carthage was founded, which, when Strabo wrote, was as prosperous as any city in Africa. It was made, in place of Utica, which had favoured the Pompeian party, the seat of the proconsul of Old Africa. It stood on the peninsula terminated by Ras-Sidi-Bou-Said, Cape Carthage or Carthagena. As Gibbon has remarked, \"The place might be unknown if some broken arches of an aqueduct did not guide the footsteps of the inquisitive traveller.\"",

      "22": "Originally a Phœnician colony, older than Carthage. It was the capital of Byzacium, and stood within the southern extremity of the Sinus Neapolitanus or Gulf of Hammamet. Trajan made it a colony, under the high-sounding name, as we gather from inscriptions, of Colonia Concordia Ulpia Trajana Augusta Frugifera Hadrumetana, or, as set forth on coins, Colonia Concordia Julia Hadrumetana Pia. The epithet Frugifera refers to the fact that it was one of the chief sea-ports for the corn-producing country of Byzacium. It was destroyed by the Vandals, but restored by the Emperor Justinian under the name of Justiniana or Justinianopolis.

    "paragraphs": [
      "A third Gulf is divided into two smaller ones, those of the two Syrtes<@1>, which are rendered perilous by the shallows of their quicksands and the ebb and flow of the sea. Polybius states the distance from Carthage to the Lesser Syrtis, the one which is nearest to it, to be 300 miles. The inlet to it he also states to be 100 miles across, and its circumference 300. There is also a way<@2> to it by land, to find which we must employ the guidance of the stars and cross deserts which present nothing but sand and serpents. After passing these we come to forests filled with vast multitudes of wild beasts and elephants, then desert wastes<@3>, and beyond them the Garamantes<@4>, distant twelve days' journey from the Augylæ<@5>. Above the Garamantes was formerly the na- tion of the Psylli<@6>, and above them again the Lake of Lycomedes<@7>, surrounded with deserts. The Augylæ themselves are situate almost midway between Æthiopia which faces the west<@8>, and the region which lies between<@9> the two Syrtes, at an equal distance from both. The distance along the coast that lies between the two Syrtes is 250 miles. On it are found the city of Œa<@10>, the river Cinyps<@11>, and the country of that name, the towns of Neapolis<@12>, Graphara<@13>, and Abrotonum<@14>, and the second, surnamed the Greater, Leptis<@15>.",
      "We next come to the Greater Syrtis, 625 miles in circumference, and at the entrance 312 miles in width; next after which dwells the nation of the Cisippades. At the bottom of this gulf was the coast of the Lotophagi, whom some writers have called the Alachroæ<@16>, extending as far as the Altars of the Philæni<@17>; these Altars are formed of heaps of sand. On passing these, not far from the shore there is a vast swamp<@18> which receives the river Triton<@19> and from it takes its name: by Callimachus it is called Pallantias<@20>, and is said by him to be on the nearer side of the Lesser Syrtis; many other writers however place it between the two Syrtes. The promontory which bounds the Greater Syrtis has the name of Borion<@21>; beyond it is the province of Cyrene.",
      "Africa, from the river Ampsaga to this limit, includes 516 peoples, who are subject to the Roman sway, of which six are colonies; among them Uthina<@22> and Tuburbi<@23>, besides those already mentioned. The towns enjoying the rights of Roman citizens are fifteen in number, of which I shall mention, as lying in the interior, those of Assuræ<@24>, Abutucum, Aborium, Canopicum<@25>, Cilma<@26>, Simithium, Thunusidium, Tuburnicum, Tynidrumum, Tibiga, the two towns called Ucita, the Greater and the Lesser, and vaga. There is also one town with Latin rights, Uzalita by name, and one town of tributaries, Castra Cornelia<@27>. The free towns are thirty in number, among which we may mention, in the interior, those of Acholla<@28>, Aggarita, Avina, Abzirita, Cano- pita, Melizita, Matera, Salaphita, Tusdrita<@29>, Tiphica, Tunica<@30>, Theuda, Tagasta<@31>, Tiga<@32>, Ulusubrita, a second Vaga, Visa, and Zama<@33>. Of the remaining number, most of them should be called, in strictness, not only cities, but nations even; such for instance as the Natabudes, the Capsitani<@34>, the Musulami, the Sabarbares, the Massyli<@35>, the Nisives, the Vamacures, the Cinithi, the Musuni, the Marchubii<@36>, and the whole of Gætulia<@37>, as far as the river Nigris<@38>, which separates Africa proper from Æthiopia."

      "2": "Marcus observes with reference to this passage, that both Hardouin and Poinsinet have mistaken its meaning. They evidently think that Pliny is speaking here of a route to the Syrtes leading from the interior of Africa, whereas it is pretty clear that he is speaking of the dangers which attend those who approach it by the line of the sea-coast, as Cato did, on his march to Utica, so beautifully described by Lucan in his Ninth Book.

It has been remarked that Pliny, here and in the Eighth Chapter of the present Book, in abridging the account given by Herodotus of the tribes of Northern Africa, has transferred to the Augylæ what that author really says of the Nasamones. This oasis forms one of the chief stations on the caravan route from Cairo to Fezzan. It is placed by Rennell in 30°3′ North Lat. and 22°46′ East Long., 180 miles south-east of Barca, 180 west by north of Siwah, the ancient Ammonium, and 426 east by north of Mourzouk.

    "paragraphs": [
      "The region of Cyrenaica, also called Pentapolis<@1>, is rendered famous by the oracle of Hammon<@2>, which is distant 400 miles from the city of Cyrene; also by the Fountain of the Sun<@3> there, and five cities in especial, those of Berenice<@4>, Arsinoë<@5>, Ptolemais<@6>, Apollonia<@7>, and Cyrene<@8> itself. Berenice is situate upon the outer promontory that bounds the Syrtis; it was formerly called the city of the Hesperides (previously mentioned<@9>), according to the fables of the Greeks, which very often change their localities. Not far from the city, and running before it, is the river Lethon, and with it a sacred grove, where the gardens of the Hesperides are said to have formerly stood; this city is distant from Leptis 375 miles. From Berenice to Arsinoë, commonly called Teuchira, is forty-three miles; after which, at a distance of twenty-two, we come to Ptolemais, the ancient name of which was Barce; and at a distance of forty miles from this last the Promontory of Phycus<@10>, which extends far away into the Cretan Sea, being 350 miles distant from Tænarum<@11>, the promontory of Laconia, and from Crete 225. After passing this promontory we come to Cyrene, which stands at a distance of eleven miles from the sea. From Phycus to Apollonia<@12> is twenty-four miles, and from thence to the Chersonesus<@13> eighty-eight; from which to Catabathmos<@14> is a distance of 216 miles. The Marmaridæ<@15> inhabit this coast, extending from almost the region of Parætonium<@16> to the Greater Syrtis; after them the Ararauceles, and then, upon the coasts of the Syrtis, the Nasamones<@17>, whom the Greeks formerly called Mesammones, from the circumstance of their being located in the very midst of sands<@18>. The territory of Cyrene, to a distance of fifteen miles from the shore, is said to abound in trees, while for the same distance beyond that district it is only suitable for the cultivation of corn: after which, a tract of land, thirty miles in breadth and 250 in length, is productive of nothing but laser [or silphium<@19>].",
      "After the Nasamones we come to the dwellings of the Asbystæ and the Macæ<@20>, and beyond them, at eleven days' journey to the west of the Greater Syrtis, the Amantes<@21>, a people also surrounded by sands in every direction. They find water however without any difficulty at a depth mostly of about two cubits, as their district receives the overflow of the waters of Mauritania. They build houses with blocks of salt<@22>, which they cut out of their mountains just as we do stone. From this nation to the Troglodytæ<@23> the distance is seven days' journey in a south-westerly direction, a people with whom our only intercourse is for the purpose of procuring from them the precious stone which we call the carbuncle, and which is brought from the interior of Æthiopia. Upon the road to this last people, but turning off towards the deserts of Africa, of which we have previously<@24> made mention as lying beyond the Lesser Syrtis, is the region of Phazania<@25>; the nation of Phazanii, belonging to which, as well as the cities of Alele<@26> and Cilliba<@27>, we have subdued by force of arms, as also Cydamus<@28>, which lies over against Sabrata. After passing these places a range of mountains extends in a prolonged chain from east to west: these have received from our people the name of the Black Mountains<@29>, either from the appearance which they naturally bear of having been exposed to the action of fire, or else from the fact that they have been scorched by the reflection of the sun's rays. Beyond it<@30> is the desert, and then Talgæ, a city of the Garamantes, and Debris, at which place there is a spring<@31>, the waters of which, from noon to midnight, are at boiling heat, and then freeze for as many hours until the following noon; Garama too, that most famous capital of the Garamantes; all which places have been subdued by the Roman arms. It was on this occasion that Cornelius Balbus<@32> was honoured with a triumph, the only foreigner indeed that was ever honoured with the triumphal chariot, and presented with the rights of a Roman citizen; for, although by birth a native of Gades, the Roman citizenship was granted to him as well as to the elder Balbus<@33>, his uncle by the father's side. There is also this remarkable circumstance, that our writers have handed down to us the names of the cities above-men- tioned as having been taken by Balbus, and have informed us that on the occasion of his triumph<@34>, besides Cydamus and Garama<@35>, there were carried in the procession the names and models of all the other nations and cities, in the following order: the town of Tabudium<@36>, the nation of Niteris, the town of Nigligemella, the nation or town of Bubeium<@37>, the nation of Enipi, the town of Thuben, the mountain known as the Black Mountain, Nitibrum, the towns called Rapsa, the nation of Discera<@38>, the town of Debris<@39>, the river Nathabur<@40>, the town of Thapsagum<@41>, the nation of Nannagi, the town of Boin, the town of Pege<@42>, the river Dasibari; and then the towns, in the following order, of Baracum, Buluba, Alasit, Galia, Balla, Maxalla<@43>, Zizama, and Mount Gyri<@44>, which was preceded by an inscription stating that this was the place where precious stones were produced.",
      "Up to the present time it has been found impracticable to keep open the road that leads to the country of the Garamantes, as the predatory bands of that nation have filled up the wells with sand, which do not require to be dug for to any great depth, if you only have a knowledge of the locality. In the late war<@45> however, which, at the beginning of the reign of the Emperor Vespasian, the Romans carried on with the people of Œa, a short cut of only four days' journey was discovered; this road is known as the \"Pæter Caput Saxi<@46>.\" The last place in the territory of Cyrenaica is Catabathmos, consisting of a town, and a valley with a sudden and steep descent. The length of Cyrenean Africa, up to this boundary from the Lesser Syrtis, is 1060 miles; and, so far as has been ascertained, it is 800<@47> in breadth."

Great quantities of this plant were also exported to Capua in Southern Italy, where it was extensively employed in the manufacture of perfumes. The scene of the 'Rudens,' the most picturesque (if we may use the term) of the plays of Plautus, is laid in the vicinity of Cyrene, and frequent reference is made in it to the extensive cultivation of silphium; a head of which plant also appears on the coins of the place.

Marcus is of opinion that the names of the places here mentioned do not succeed in any geographical order, but solely according to their presumed importance as forming part of the conquest of Balbus.

The distance from Catabathmos to Parætonium is eighty-six miles. In this district is Apis<@2>, a place rendered famous by the religious belief of Egypt. From this town Parætonium is distant sixty-two miles, and from thence to Alexandria the distance is 200 miles, the breadth of the district being 169. Eratosthenes says that it is 525 miles by land from Cyrene to Alexandria; while Agrippa gives the length of the whole of Africa from the Atlantic Sea, and including Lower Egypt, as 3040 miles. Polybius and Eratosthenes, who are generally considered as remarkable for their extreme correctness, state the length to be, from the ocean to Great Carthage 1100 miles, and from Carthage to Canopus, the nearest mouth of the Nile, 1628 miles; while Isidorus speaks of the distance from Tingi to Canopus as being 3599 miles. Artemidorus makes this last distance forty miles less than Isidorus."

      "1": "The Mareotis of the time of the Ptolemies extended from Alexandria to the Gulf of Plinthinethes; and Libya was properly that portion of territory which extended from that Gulf to Catabathmos. Pliny is in error here in confounding the two appellations, or rather, blending them into one. It includes the eastern portion of the modern Barca, and the western division of Lower Egypt. It most probably received its name from the Lake Mareotis, and not the lake from it.",
      "2": "This was a seaport town on the northern coast of Africa, probably about eleven or twelve miles west of Parætonium, sometimes spoken of as belonging to Egypt, sometimes to Marmorica. Scylax places it at the western boundary of Egypt, on the frontier of the Marmaridæ. Ptolemy, like Pliny, speaks of it as being in the Libyan Nomos. The distances given in the MSS. of Pliny of this place from Parætonium are seventy-two, sixty-two, and twelve miles; the latter is probably the correct reading, as Strabc, B. xvii., makes the distance 100 stadia. It is extremely doubtful whether the Apis mentioned by Herodotus, B. ii. c. 18, can be the same place: but there is little doubt, from the words of Pliny here, that it was dedicated to the worship of the Egyptian god Apis, who was represented under the form of a bull."

This island has two towns, Meninx on the side which faces Africa, and Troas on the other; it is situate off the promontory which lies on the right-hand side of the Lesser Syrtis, at a distance of a mile and a half. One hundred miles from this island, and opposite the promontory that lies on the left, is the free island of Cercina<@2>, with a city of the same name. It is twenty-five miles long, and half that breadth at the place where it is the widest, but not more than five miles across at the extremity: the diminutive island of Cercinitis<@3>, which looks towards Carthage, is united to it by a bridge. At a distance of nearly fifty miles from these is the island of Lopadusa<@4>, six miles in length; and beyond it Gaulos and Galata, the soil of which kills the scorpion, that noxious reptile of Africa. It is also said that the scorpion will not live at Clypea; opposite to which place lies the island of Cosyra<@5>, with a town of the same name. Opposite to the Gulf of Carthage are the two islands known as the Ægimuri<@6>; the Altars<@7>, which are rather rocks than islands, lie more between Sicily and Sardinia.

      "If we pass through the interior of Africa in a southerly direction, beyond the Gætuli, after having traversed the intervening deserts, we shall find, first of all the Liby- Egyptians<@1>, and then the country where the Leucæthio- pians<@2> dwell. Beyond<@3> these are the Nigritæ<@4>, nations of Æthiopia, so called from the river Nigris<@5>, which has been previously mentioned, the Gymnetes<@6>, surnamed Pharusii, and, on the very margin of the ocean, the Perorsi<@7>, whom we have already spoken of as lying on the boundaries of Mauritania. After passing all these peoples, there are vast deserts towards the east until we come to the Garamantes, the Augylæ, and the Troglodytæ; the opinion of those being exceedingly well founded who place two Æthiopias beyond the deserts of Africa, and more particularly that expressed by Homer<@8>, who tells us that the Æthiopians are divided into two nations, those of the east and those of the west. The river Nigris has the same characteristics as the Nile; it produces the calamus, the papyrus, and just the same animals, and it rises at the same seasons of the year. Its source is between the Tarrælian Æthiopians and the Œcalicæ. Magium, the city of the latter people, has been placed by some writers amid the deserts, and, next to them the Atlantes; then the Ægipani, half men, half beasts, the Blemmyæ<@9>, the Gamphasantes, the Satyri, and the Himantopodes.",
      "The Atlantes<@10>, if we believe what is said, have lost all characteristics of humanity; for there is no mode of distinguishing each other among them by names, and as they look upon the rising and the setting sun, they give utterance to direful imprecations against it, as being deadly to themselves and their lands; nor are they visited with dreams<@11>, like the rest of mortals. The Troglodytæ make excavations in the earth, which serve them for dwellings; the flesh of serpents is their food; they have no articulate voice, but only utter a kind of squeaking noise<@12>; and thus are they utterly destitute of all means of communication by language. The Garamantes have no institution of marriage among them, and live in promiscuous concubinage with their women. The Augylæ worship no deities<@13> but the gods of the infernal regions. The Gamphasantes, who go naked, and are unacquainted with war<@14>, hold no intercourse whatever with strangers. The Blemmyæ are said to have no heads, their mouths and eyes being seated in their breasts. The Satyri<@15>, beyond their figure, have nothing in common with the manners of the human race, and the form of the Ægipani<@16> is such as is commonly represented in paintings. The Himantopodes<@17> are a race of people with feet resembling thongs, upon which they move along by nature with a serpentine, crawling kind of gait. The Pharusii, descended from the ancient Persians, are said to have been the companions of Hercules when on his expedition to the Hesperides. Beyond the above, I have met with nothing relative to Africa<@18> worthy of mention."

From a statement in the Æthiopica of Heliodorus, B. x., Marcus suggests that the story as to the Blemmyee having no heads arose from the circumstance, that on the invasion of the Persians they were in the habit of falling on one knee and bowing the head to the breast, by which means, without injury to themselves, they afforded a passage to the horses of the enemy.",

By the Canopic mouth of that river it is separated from Africa, and by the Pelusiac from Asia, there being a distance between the two of 170 miles.

    "paragraphs": [
      "The sources of the Nile<@1> are unascertained, and, travelling as it does for an immense distance through deserts and burning sands, it is only known to us by common report, having neither experienced the vicissitudes of warfare, nor been visited by those arms which have so effectually explored all other regions. It rises, so far indeed as King Juba was enabled to ascertain, in a mountain<@2> of Lower Mauritania, not far from the ocean; immediately after which it forms a lake of standing water, which bears the name of Nilides<@3>. In this lake are found the several kinds of fish known by the names of alabeta<@4>, coracinus, and silurus; a crocodile also was brought thence as a proof that this really is the Nile, and was consecrated by Juba himself in the temple of Isis at Cæsarea<@5>, where it may be seen at the present day. In addition to these facts, it has been observed that the waters of the Nile rise in the same proportion in which the snows and rains of Mauritania increase. Pouring forth from this lake, the river disdains to flow through arid and sandy deserts, and for a distance of several days' journey conceals itself; after which it bursts forth at another lake of greater magnitude in the country of the Massæsyli<@6>, a people of Mauritania Cæsariensis, and thence casts a glance around, as it were, upon the communities of men in its vicinity, giving proofs of its identity in the same peculiarities of the animals which it produces. It then buries itself once again in the sands of the desert, and remains concealed for a distance of twenty days' journey, till it has reached the confines of Æthiopia. Here, when it has once more become sensible of the presence of man, it again emerges, at the same source, in all probability, to which writers have given the name of Niger, or Black. After this, forming the boundary-line between Africa and Æthiopia, its banks, though not immediately peopled by man, are the resort of numbers of wild beasts and animals of various kinds. Giving birth in its course to dense forests of trees, it travels through the middle of Æthiopia, under the name of Astapus, a word which signifies, in the language of the nations who dwell in those regions, \"water issuing from the shades below.\" Proceeding onwards, it divides<@7> innumerable islands in its course, and some of them of such vast magnitude, that although its tide runs with the greatest rapidity, it is not less than five days in passing them. When making the circuit of Meroë, the most famous of these islands, the left branch of the river is called Astobores<@8>, or, in other words, \"an arm of the water that issues from the shades,\" while the right arm has the name of Astosapes<@9>, which adds to its original signification the meaning of \"side<@10>.\" It does not obtain the name of \"Nile\" until its waters have again met and are united in a single stream; and even then, for some miles both above and below the point of confluence, it has the name of Siris. Homer has given to the whole of this river the name of Ægyptus, while other writers again have called it Triton<@11>. Every now and then its course is interrupted by islands which intervene, and which only serve as so many incentives to add to the impetuosity of its torrent; and though at last it is hemmed in by mountains on either side, in no part is the tide more rapid and precipitate. Its waters then hastening onwards, it is borne along to the spot in the country of the Æthiopians which is known by the name of \"Catadupi<@12>;\" where, at the last Cataract<@13>, the complaint is, not that it flows, but that it rushes, with an immense noise between the rocks that lie in its way: after which it becomes more smooth, the violence of its waters is broken and subdued, and, wearied out as it were by the length of the distance it has travelled, it discharges itself, though by many mouths<@14>, into the Egyptian sea. During certain days of the year, however, the volume of its waters is greatly increased, and as it traverses the whole of Egypt, it inundates the earth, and, by so doing, greatly promotes its fertility.",
      "There have been various reasons suggested for this increase of the river. Of these, however, the most probable are, either that its waters are driven back by the Etesian winds<@15>, which are blowing at this season of the year from an opposite direction, and that the sea which lies beyond is driven into the mouths of the river; or else that its waters are swollen by the summer rains of Æthiopia<@16>, which fall from the clouds conveyed thither by the Etesian winds from other parts of the earth. Timæus the mathematician has alleged a reason of an occult nature: he says that the source of the river is known by the name of Phiala, and that the stream buries itself in channels underground, where it sends forth vapours generated by the heat among the steaming rocks amid which it conceals itself; but that, during the days of the inundation, in consequence of the sun approaching nearer to the earth, the waters are drawn forth by the influence of his heat, and on being thus exposed to the air, overflow; after which, in order that it may not be utterly dried up, the stream hides itself once more. He says that this takes place at the rising of the Dog-Star, when the sun enters the sign of Leo, and stands in a vertical position over the source of the river, at which time at that spot there is no shadow thrown. Most authors, however, are of opinion, on the contrary, that the river flows in greater volume when the sun takes his departure for the north, which he does when he enters the signs of Cancer and Leo, because its waters then are not dried up to so great an extent; while on the other hand, when he returns towards the south pole and re-enters Capricorn, its waters are absorbed by the heat, and consequently flow in less abundance. If there is any one inclined to be of opinion, with Timæus, that the waters of the river may be drawn out of the earth by the heat, it will be as well for him to bear in mind the fact, that the absence of shadow is a phænomenon which lasts continuously<@17> in these regions.",
      "The Nile begins to increase at the next new moon after the summer solstice, and rises slowly and gradually as the sun passes through the sign of Cancer; it is at its greatest height while the sun is passing through Leo, and it falls as slowly and gradually as it arose while he is passing through the sign of Virgo. It has totally subsided between its banks, as we learn from Herodotus, on the hundredth day, when the sun has entered Libra. While it is rising it has been pronounced criminal for kings or prefects even to sail upon its waters. The measure of its increase is ascertained by means of wells<@18>. Its most desirable height is sixteen cubits<@19>; if the waters do not attain that height, the overflow is not universal; but if they exceed that measure, by their slowness in receding they tend to retard the process of cultivation. In the latter case the time for sowing is lost, in consequence of the moisture of the soil; in the former, the ground is so parched that the seed-time comes to no purpose. The country has reason to make careful note of either extreme. When the water rises to only twelve cubits, it experiences the horrors of famine; when it attains thirteen, hunger is still the result; a rise of fourteen cubits is productive of gladness; a rise of fifteen sets all anxieties at rest; while an increase of sixteen is productive of unbounded transports of joy. The greatest increase known, up to the present time, is that of eighteen cubits, which took place in the time of the Emperor Claudius; the smallest rise was that of five, in the year of the battle of Pharsalia<@20>, the river by this prodigy testifying its horror, as it were, at the murder of Pompeius Magnus. When the waters have reached their greatest height, the people open the embankments and admit them to the lands. As each district is left by the waters, the business of sowing commences. This is the only river in existence that emits no vapours<@21>.",
      "The Nile first enters the Egyptian territory at Syene<@22>, on the frontiers of Æthiopia; that is the name of a peninsula a mile in circumference, upon which Castra<@23> is situate, on the side of Arabia. Opposite to it are the four islands of Philæ<@24>, at a distance of 600 miles from the place where the Nile divides into two channels; at which spot, as we have already stated, the Delta, as it is called, begins. This, at least, is the distance, according to Artemidorus, who also informs us that there were in it 250 towns; Juba says, however, that the distance between these places is 400 miles. Aristocreon says that the distance from Elephantis to the sea is 750 miles; Elephantis<@25> being an inhabited island four miles below the last Cataract, sixteen<@26> beyond Syene, 585 from Alexandria, and the extreme limit of the navigation of Egypt. To such an extent as this have the above-named authors<@27> been mistaken! This island is the place of rendezvous for the vessels of the Æthiopians: they are made to fold up<@28>, and the people carry them on their shoulders whenever they come to the Cataracts."

    "paragraphs": [
      "Egypt, besides its boast of extreme antiquity, asserts that it contained, in the reign of King Amasis<@1>, 20,000 inhabited cities: in our day they are still very numerous, though no longer of any particular note. Still however we find the following ones mentioned as of great renown—the city of Apollo<@2>; next, that of Leucothea<@3>; then Great Diospolis<@4>, otherwise Thebes, known to fame for its hundred gates; Coptos<@5>, which from its proximity to the Nile, forms its nearest emporium for the merchandise of India and Arabia; then the town of Venus<@6>, and then another town of Jupi- ter<@7>. After this comes Tentyris<@8>, below which is Abydus<@9>, the royal abode of Memnon, and famous for a temple of Osiris<@10>, which is situate in Libya<@11>, at a distance from the river of seven miles and a half. Next to it comes Ptolemais<@12>, then Panopolis<@13>, and then another town of Venus<@14>, and, on the Libyan side, Lycon<@15>, where the mountains form the boundary of the province of Thebais. On passing these, we come to the towns of Mercury<@16>, Alabastron<@17>, the town of Dogs<@18>, and that of Hercules already mentioned<@19>. We next come to Arsinoë<@20>, and Memphis<@21>, which has been previously mentioned; between which last and the Nome of Arsinoïtes, upon the Libyan side, are the towers known as the Pyramids, the Labyrinth<@22> on Lake Mœris, in the construction of which no wood was employed, and the town of Crialon<@23>. Besides these, there is one place in the interior, on the confines of Arabia, of great celebrity, the City of the Sun<@24>.",
      "(10.) With the greatest justice, however, we may lavish our praises upon Alexandria, built by Alexander the Great on the shores of the Egyptian Sea, upon the soil of Africa, at twelve miles' distance from the Canopic Mouth and near Lake Mareotis<@25>; the spot having previously borne the name of Rhacotes. The plan of this city was designed by the architect Dinochares<@26>, who is memorable for the genius which he displayed in many ways. Building the city upon a wide space<@27> of ground fifteen miles in circumference, he formed it in the circular shape of a Macedonian chlamys<@28>, uneven at the edge, giving it an angular projection on the right and left; while at the same time he devoted one-fifth part of the site to the royal palace.",
      "Lake Mareotis, which lies on the south side of the city, is connected by a canal which joins it to the Canopic mouth, and serves for the purposes of communication with the interior. It has also a great number of islands, and is thirty miles across, and 150 in circumference, according to Claudius Cæsar. Other writers say that it is forty schœni in length, making the schœnum to be thirty stadia; hence, according to them, it is 150 miles<@29> in length and the same in breadth.",
      "There are also, in the latter part of the course of the Nile, many towns of considerable celebrity, and more especially those which have given their names to the mouths of the river—I do not mean, all the mouths, for there are no less than twelve of them, as well as four others, which the people call the False Mouths<@30>. I allude to the seven more famous ones, the Canopic<@31> Mouth, next to Alexandria, those of Bolbitine<@32>, Sebennys<@33>, Phatnis<@34>, Mendes<@35>, Tanis<@36>, and, last of all, Pelusium<@37>. Besides the above there are the towns of Butos<@38>, Pharbæthos<@39>, Leontopolis<@40>, Athribis<@41>, the town of Isis<@42>, Busiris<@43>, Cynopolis<@44>, Aphrodites<@45>, Sais<@46>, and Naucratis<@47>, from which last some writers call that the Naucratitic Mouth, which is by others called the Heracleotic, and mention it instead<@48> of the Canopic Mouth, which is the next to it."

Its priests were the great depositaries of the theological and historical learning of Egypt. Solon, Thales, and Plato were reputed each to have visited its schools.

It was the capital of the nome Heliopolites, and paid worship to the sun and the bull Mnevis, the rival of Apis. From Josephus we learn that after the dispersion and fall of the tribes of Judah and Israel, great numbers of the Jews took refuge at this place, forming almost one-half of its population. The ruins, which were extremely magnificent, occupied in the twelfth century an area nearly three miles in extent. Pliny speaks of the great obelisk there, which is still standing.

It was the ancient capital of Lower Egypt and contained the palace and burial-place of the Pharaohs. It was the chief seat of the worship of the Egyptian goddess Neith, also known as Sais. It gave its name to the nome of Saïtes.",

It was the only place in Egypt in which, in the time of the later Pharaohs, foreigners were permitted to settle and trade.

      "Beyond Idumæa and Samaria, Judæa extends far and wide. That part of it which joins up to Syria<@1> is called Galilæa, while that which is nearest to Arabia and Egypt bears the name of Peræa<@2>. This last is thickly covered with rugged mountains, and is separated from the rest of Judæa by the river Jordanes. The remaining part of Judæa is divided into ten Toparchies, which we will mention in the following order:—That of Hiericus<@3>, covered with groves of palm-trees, and watered by numerous springs, and those of Emmaüs<@4>, Lydda<@5>, Joppe, Acrabatena<@6>, Gophna<@7>, Thamna<@8>, Bethleptephene<@9>, Orina<@10>, in which formerly stood Hierosolyma<@11>, by far the most famous city, not of Judæa only, but of the East, and Herodium<@12>, with a celebrated town of the same name.",
      "(15.) The river Jordanes<@13> rises from the spring of Panias<@14>, which has given its surname to Cæsarea, of which we shall have occasion to speak<@15>. This is a delightful stream, and, so far as the situation of the localities will allow of, winds along<@16> in its course and lingers among the dwellers upon its banks. With the greatest reluctance, as it were, it moves onward towards Asphaltites<@17>, a lake of a gloomy and unpropitious nature, by which it is at last swallowed up, and its be praised waters are lost sight of on being mingled with the pestilential streams of the lake. For this reason it is that, as soon as ever the valleys through which it runs afford it the opportunity, it discharges itself into a lake, by many writers known as Genesara<@18>, sixteen miles in length and six wide; which is skirted by the pleasant towns of Julias<@19> and Hippo<@20> on the east, of Tarichea<@21> on the south (a name which is by many persons given to the lake itself), and of Tiberias<@22> on the west, the hot springs<@23> of which are so conducive to the restoration of health.",
      "(16.) Asphaltites<@24> produces nothing whatever except bitu- men, to which indeed it owes its name. The bodies of animals will not sink<@25> in its waters, and even those of bulls and camels float there. In length it exceeds 100 miles being at its greatest breadth twenty-five, and at its smallest six. Arabia of the Nomades<@26> faces it on the east, and Machærus on the south<@27>, at one time, next to Hierosolyma, the most strongly fortified place in Judæa. On the same side lies Callirrhoë<@28>, a warm spring, remarkable for its medicinal qualities, and which, by its name, indicates the celebrity its waters have gained.",
      "(17.) Lying on the west of Asphaltites, and sufficiently distant to escape its noxious exhalations, are the Esseni<@29>, a people that live apart from the world, and marvellous beyond all others throughout the whole earth, for they have no women among them; to sexual desire they are strangers; money they have none; the palm-trees are their only companions. Day after day, however, their numbers are fully recruited by multitudes of strangers that resort to them, driven thither to adopt their usages by the tempests of fortune, and wearied with the miseries of life. Thus it is, that through thousands of ages, incredible to relate, this people eternally prolongs its existence, without a single birth taking place there; so fruitful a source of population to it is that weariness of life which is felt by others. Below this people was formerly the town of Engadda<@30>, second only to Hierosolyma in the fertility of its soil and its groves of palm-trees; now, like it, it is another heap of ashes. Next to it we come to Masada<@31>, a fortress on a rock, not far from Lake Asphaltites. Thus much concerning Judæa."

They are not mentioned by name in the New Testament, but it has been conjectured that they are alluded to in Matt. xix. 12, and Col. ii. 18, 23. As stated here by Pliny, they generally lived at a distance from large towns, in communities which bore a great resemblance to the monkish societies of later times. They sent gifts to the Temple at Jerusalem, but never offered sacrifices there. They were divided into four classes, according to the time of their initiation. Their origin is uncertain. Some writers look upon them as the same as the Assidians, or Chasidim, mentioned in 1 Maccabees, ii. 42, vii. 13. Their principal society was probably the one mentioned by Pliny, and from this other smaller ones proceeded, and spread over Palestine, Syria, and Egypt. The Essenes of Egypt were divided into two sects; the practical Essenes, whose mode of life was the same as those of Palestine; and the contemplative Essenes, who were called Therapeutœ. Both sects maintained the same doctrines; but the latter were distinguished by a more rigid mode of life. It has been suggested by Taylor, the editor of 'Calmet's Dictionary of the Bible,' that John the Baptist belonged to this sect.",
      "30": "Or Engedi. Its ancient name was Hazezon-Tamar, when it was inhabited by the Amorites. See Gen. xiv. 7; 2 Chron. xx. 2. According to Josephus, it gave name to one of the fifteen toparchies of Judæa. It still retains its name, Ain-Jedey, or \"Fountain of the Goats,\" and was so called from a spring which issued out of the limestone rock at the base of a lofty cliff.",

Close to this river is Ptolemais, formerly called Ace<@9>, a colony of Claudius Cæsar; and then the town of Ecdippa<@10>, and the promontory known as the White Promontory<@11>. We next come to the city of Tyre<@12>, formerly an island, separated from the mainland by a channel of the sea, of great depth, 700 paces in width, but now joined to it by the works which were thrown up by Alexander when besieging it,—the Tyre so famous in ancient times for its offspring, the cities to which it gave birth, Leptis, Utica, and Carthage<@13>,— that rival of the Roman sway, that thirsted so eagerly for the conquest of the whole earth; Gades, too, which she founded beyond the limits of the world.

Opposite to this chain, and separated from it by an intervening valley, stretches away the range of Antilibanus, which was formerly connected with Libanus<@20> by a wall. Beyond it, and lying in the interior, is the region of Decapolis, and, with it, the Tetrarchies already mentioned, and the whole expanse of Palæstina.
